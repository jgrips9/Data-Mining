FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 AND 2020
(Unaudited)
  Note 1 – Description of Business

NOTES TO CONDENSED  INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 AND 2020
(Unaudited)
   Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation – The condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the Company has made all necessary adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, for a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. Certain information and disclosures included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2020, included in the Company’s annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 31, 2021. The results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, and 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, any other interim periods or any future year or period.
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries AgEagle Aerial, Inc., AgEagle Sensors, Inc., MicaSense, Inc., and Measure Global, Inc., Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements. Such consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
  Correction of Prior Period Information – During the review of the Company’s financial statements for the interim period June 30, 2021, the Company identified an error in the accounting and presentation of revenue and related expenses recorded for the MicaSense acquisition related to the three months ended March 31, 2021. This error resulted in the recording of $394,743 in additional revenue, $129,510 in additional cost of goods sold, and $232,252 in additional operating expenses, resulting in additional net income of $32,033. If reported correctly, the Company would have recorded $1,306,849 in revenue, $492,394 in cost of goods sold, $3,808,236 in operating expenses, and a net loss of ($2,962,563) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. To correct this error, the Company recorded the correction in the three month period ended June 30, 2021. Instead, the Company recorded revenue of $1,701,592, cost of goods sold of $621,904, operating expenses of $4,040,488, and a net loss of ($2,930,530) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. If reported correctly for the three months ended June 30, 2021, then the Company would have reported $2,332,107 in revenue, $1,088,739 in cost of goods sold, $6,030,872 in operating expenses, and a net loss of ($4,646,139). In accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 99 and 108 (SAB 99 and SAB 108), the Company evaluated this error and concluded that although the adjustment to revenue was quantitatively material, the cumulative effects were quantitatively and qualitatively immaterial and would not have materially impacted a reasonable investor’s opinion of the Company. This is further supported by the fact that the impact would not have been significant in comparison to prior periods, as the financial results still supported the Company’s increased year-over-year growth in revenue as reported and discussed in both periods within the Management Discussion & Analysis. Therefore, as permitted by SAB 108 and treated under ASC 250 revisions, the Company corrected previously recorded results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, to account for the error in this current filing. As a result, the statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflects the corrected revenues, cost of goods sold, operating expenses and net loss.
Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the reserve for obsolete inventory, valuation of stock issued for services and stock options, valuation of intangible assets including goodwill and the valuation of deferred tax assets.
  Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic– In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was reported. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
  As of June 30, 2021, our locations and primary suppliers continue to operate. During the first half of 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of the vaccine against COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. However, infection rates and regulation continue to fluctuate, and there continues to be global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including increases in costs in connection with logistics services and supply chains, port congestion, supplier delays and shortfalls in microchip supply. We continue to work through supplier constraints caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the microchip shortage.

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 AND 2020
(Unaudited)
  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Continued
  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures – The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) requires companies to determine fair value based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.
  The guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
  ● Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
    ● Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
    ● Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
    The carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and note payable. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value. As of June 30, 2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis.
  Concentrations – The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. The Company’s bank balances at times may exceed the FDIC limit. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on its invested cash.
  As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, there was one significant vendor that the Company relied upon to perform certain services for the Company’s technology platforms. This vendor provides services to the Company which can be replaced by alternative vendors should the need arise.
  Receivables and Credit Policy – Trade receivables due from customers are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the amount billed to the customer. The Company generally does not charge interest on overdue customer account balances. Payments of trade receivables are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customer’s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices. Accounts receivable at June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $814,712 and $0, respectively.
  The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an evaluation of the current status of receivables, historical experience, and other factors as necessary. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. The Company determined that $47,262 on allowance was necessary as of June 30, 2021 and no allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2020.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Continued
   Inventories – Inventories, which consist of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined by the average-cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. The Company’s sensor equipment is manufactured by a third-party organization. Cost components include direct materials and direct labor. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation primarily includes an analysis of forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, among consideration of other factors. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. Based upon the evaluation, provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company’s estimates and expectations. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a provision for obsolescence of $10,000.
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets – The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.
  Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology, and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from two to ten years.
  Business Combinations – The Company recognizes, with certain exceptions, 100% of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Shares issued in consideration for a business combination, contingent consideration arrangements and pre-acquisition loss and gain contingencies are all measured and recorded at their acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes to fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are generally reflected in earnings. Any in-process research and development assets acquired are capitalized as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. The operating results of entities acquired are included in the accompanying condensed interim consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.

  Revenue Recognition and Concentration – The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated primarily by three segments of the business; 1) the sale of sensors and cameras along with the related accessories- 2) contractual agreements to develop, manufacture and/or modify complex drone related products, and to provide associated engineering, technical and other services according to customer specifications and 3) Software-as-a-Service (“SAAS) subscription sales. All contracts and agreements are a fixed price and are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
  The Company generally recognizes revenue on sales to customers, dealers and distributors upon satisfaction of performance obligations which generally occurs once controls transfer to customers, which is when product is shipped or delivered depending on specific shipping terms and, where applicable, a customer acceptance has been obtained. The fee is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved. The Company records revenue in the statements of operations net of any sales, use, value added, or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions and net of any discounts, allowances and returns.
  Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company’s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, it will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. The Company accounts for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
  Additionally, customer payments received in advance of the Company completing performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities. Customer deposits represent customer prepayments and are recognized as revenue when the term of the sale or performance obligation are completed. The balance of contract liabilities as of June 30, 2021, was $504,180 and $2,302 as of December 31, 2020.
  The Company’s FarmLens, Atlas and Ground Control platforms are offered on a subscription basis. These subscription fees are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period as the services are provided.
  Sales concentration information for customers comprising more than 10% of the Company’s total net sales is summarized as follows:
              Percent of total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30,
Customers   2021   2020
Customer A     — %     91.8 %
  No accounts receivable was due from Customer A as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

   The table below reflects our revenue for the quarters indicated by product mix.

Total   $ 1,937,364     $ 16,325     $ 3,638,955     $ 407,605  
  Shipping Costs – Shipping costs recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $15,694 and $5,723, respectively and $35,590, and $6,024 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All shipping costs billed directly to the customer are directly offset to shipping costs resulting in a net expense to the Company which is included in cost of goods sold on the accompanying condensed interim consolidated statements of operations.
  Research and Development Expenses – Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included as part of the accompanying condensed interim consolidated statements of operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company recorded research and development costs of $907,000 and $1,335,605, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, no research and development costs were recorded during that period.
  Loss Per Common Share – Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus Common Stock, par value $0.001 (“Common Stock”), equivalents (if dilutive) related to warrants, options and convertible instruments.
  Potentially Dilutive Securities – The Company has excluded all common equivalent shares outstanding for warrants, options and convertible instruments to purchase Common Stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, because all such securities are anti-dilutive for the periods presented. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had no warrants and 2,311,167 options to purchase Common Stock. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had 3,283,697 warrants, and 2,550,387 options to purchase Common Stock.
  Leases – The Company accounts for its operating leases in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842). Lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all their leases. Additionally, the Company recognizes assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.
    Income Taxes – The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. This topic requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes. The Company evaluates its tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on income tax returns to determine if an accrual is necessary for uncertain tax positions. The Company will recognize future accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense if incurred. All income tax returns not filed more than three years ago are subject to federal and state tax examinations by tax authorities.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Continued
  Stock-Based Compensation Awards – The Company accounts for its stock-based awards in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10, ”Compensation – Stock Compensation,” which requires fair value measurement on the grant date and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors. For stock options, the Company estimates the fair value using a closed option valuation (Black-Scholes) model. The estimated fair value is then expensed over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the vesting period, and the related amount is recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within general and administrative expenses. The Company recognizes forfeitures at the time they occur.
  The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of certain assumptions that require the Company’s judgment, including the expected term and the expected stock price volatility of the underlying stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change resulting in the use of different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which provides guidance on how an entity should measure credit losses on financial instruments. The ASU is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
  In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” The guidance issued in this update simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in ASC 740 related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition for deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The ASU became effective for the Company on March 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

  Note 4 – Notes Receivable
  On October 14, 2020, the Company executed a Convertible Promissory Note pursuant to which the Company has made a loan to Valqari, LLC (“Valqari”), in the principal aggregate amount of $500,000 (the “Note”), which amount accrues interest at a rate of three percent per annum.
  The loan matured on April 15, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time all outstanding principal and interest that has accrued, but remains, unpaid was due. The Note provides for an automatic six month extension of the Maturity Date under the following circumstances (i) Valqari has received in writing, (x) a good faith acquisition offer at a consideration value greater than $15,000,000, (y) such offer, upon consummation, would result in a change in control (as defined in the note) of Valqari, and (z) at such time Valqari, is actively engaged in the negotiation or finalization of such acquisition transaction; or (ii) Valqari has initiated, or is in the process of initiating, a conversion to a “C-Corporation” under the Internal Revenue Code, whereas such conversion will be completed no later than one day prior to the extended Maturity Date. Valqari may not prepay the Note prior to the Maturity Date. On April 15, 2021, the Note was extended for an additional six months as outlined per the agreement until October 15, 2021.
   In the event of a change in control or conversion of Valqari to a “C-Corporation” under the Internal Revenue Code on or before the Maturity Date, the Company may convert the outstanding principal amount of the Note and any unpaid accrued interest into (i) Class B Common Units of Valqari: immediately prior to the closing of a Change in Control or (ii) upon Valqari’s conversion to a C-corporation, shares of Valqari Common Stock, in both cases at a conversion price no higher than a pre-money valuation of $15,000,000.
  The Note is subject to customary representations and warranties by Valqari, as well as events of default, which may lead to acceleration of the payment of the Note such as (i) failure to pay all of the outstanding principal, plus accrued interest on the Maturity Date, (ii) Valqari filing a petition or action under any bankruptcy, or other law, or (iii) an involuntary petition is filed again Valqari under any bankruptcy statute (that is not dismissed or discharged within 60 days). The indebtedness evidenced by the Note is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of any senior indebtedness (as defined in the Note) in existence on the date of the Note or incurred thereafter.
  AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest; based on the initial maturity date of April 14, 2021; however, Valqari has alleged that the note’s maturity date was extended to October 14, 2021.  AgEagle disputes this extension; however, for practical reasons AgEagle intends to wait until October in order to pursue collection actions, if necessary.
   On November 16, 2020, the Company (Payee) executed a promissory note in connection with a proposed acquisition (the “Proposed Acquisition”) by the Payee or its affiliate, for 100% of the capital stock of MicaSense Inc., (“MicaSense”). As of June 30, 2021, Parrot Drones S.A.S. promised to pay to the Company the principal amount of $100,000 provided, however that such principal amount was off-set and reduced by all amounts paid or due in connection with the purchase price upon closing of the Proposed Acquisition.

  Note 7 – Acquisition
  On January 27, 2021, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “MicaSense Purchase Agreement”) with Parrot Drones S.A.S. and Justin B. McAllister (the “MicaSense Sellers”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of MicaSense, Inc. (“MicaSense”) from the MicaSense Sellers. MicaSense is based in Washington and manufactures and sells its patented, high precision thermal and multispectral sensors, serving the aerial mapping and analytics needs of the agriculture market. In addition, MicaSense’s patented technologies are well positioned to address applications in advanced inspection in the energy, construction and government sectors, among other solutions. MicaSense’s high performance proprietary products, including Altum, RedEdge-MX, RedEdge-MX Blue and Atlas Flight, have global distribution in over 70 countries. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of MicaSense was $23,000,000, less any debt and subject to a customary working capital adjustment. A portion of the consideration is comprised of shares of common stock of the Company, having an aggregate value of $3,000,000 based on a volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock over a ten consecutive trading day period prior to the date of issuance of the shares of Common Stock to the MicaSense Sellers on April 27, 2021 (the “Shares”), in the amount of 540,541 restricted shares of Common Stock. The consideration is also subject to a $4,750,000 holdback to cover any post-closing indemnification claims and to satisfy any purchase price adjustments. The holdback is scheduled to be released in two equal installments, less any amounts paid or reserved for outstanding indemnity claims, on March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023 in accordance with the terms of the MicaSense Purchase Agreement. As a result of this transaction, MicaSense is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
  The Company filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement (the “Registration Statement”) covering the resale of the Shares with the SEC on May 10, 2021. The Registration Statement was declared effective on June 1, 2021 (File Number: 333-255940). In addition, the Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act (including by preparing and filing with the SEC such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and supplements to the Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary) until all Shares and other securities covered by such Registration Statement have been disposed of. The MicaSense Sellers are required to reimburse the Company up to $50,000 for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such registration.

  The MicaSense Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including representations and warranties by the MicaSense Sellers with respect to MicaSense’s business, operations and financial condition. The MicaSense Purchase Agreement also includes post-closing covenants relating to the confidentiality and employee non-solicitation obligations of the MicaSense Sellers, and the agreement of the MicaSense Sellers not to compete with certain aspects of the business of MicaSense following the closing of the transaction. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the MicaSense Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others: (i) the absence of a material adverse effect on MicaSense, (ii) the delivery by the parties of certain ancillary documents, including the Registration Rights Agreement, and (iii) the execution by a key employee of MicaSense of an employment agreement. Subject to certain limitations, each of the parties will be indemnified for damages resulting from third party claims and breaches of the parties’ respective representations, warranties, and covenants in the MicaSense Purchase Agreement.
.
The fair value of the purchase consideration was allocated to the net tangible assets acquired and to the separately identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the aggregate fair value of the net tangible assets and identified intangible assets has been treated as goodwill in accordance with ASC 805.
  The Company has performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Using the total consideration for the Acquisition, the Company has estimated the allocations to such assets and liabilities.
  The final purchase price allocation will be determined when the Company has completed the detailed valuations and necessary calculations. The final allocation could differ materially from the preliminary allocation used in the pro forma adjustments. The final allocation may include (1) changes in fair values of tangible assets; (2) changes in allocations to intangible assets such as trade names, developed technology and customer relationships, as well as goodwill; and (3) other changes to assets and liabilities. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has recorded a change to Goodwill as a result of changes in the preliminary allocation used to determine revenue and costs attributed to the purchase price allocation.
  The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price as of the acquisition date of January 27, 2021:

  Note 7 – Acquisition – Continued
  On April 19, 2021, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Measure Purchase Agreement”) with Brandon Torres Declet, in his capacity as Measure Sellers’ representative, and the sellers named in the Measure Purchase Agreement (the “Measure Sellers”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Measure Global Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Measure”) from the Measure Sellers. Measure is an aerial intelligence company that builds software to automate drone operations workflows. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of Measure is $45,000,000, less the amount of Measure’s debt and transaction expenses and subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The purchase price is comprised of $15,000,000 in cash, and shares of common stock of the Company, having an aggregate value of $30,000,000 based on a volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock over a seven consecutive trading day period prior to the date of issuance of the shares of Common Stock to the Measure Sellers (the “Shares”). The Company issued 5,319,145 shares, in the aggregate, to the Measure Sellers and will pay $5,000,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price 90 days after the closing date of the transaction. As a result of this transaction, Measure is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
  The consideration is also subject to a $5,625,000 holdback to cover any post-closing indemnification claims and to satisfy any purchase price adjustments. The holdback is scheduled to be released on the date that is 18 months from the closing date, less any amounts paid or reserved for outstanding indemnity claims and certain amounts subject to employee retention conditions set forth in the Measure Purchase Agreement.
  The Measure Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including representations and warranties by the Measure Sellers with respect to Measure’s business, operations and financial condition. The Measure Purchase Agreement also includes post-closing covenants relating to the confidentiality and employee non-solicitation obligations of the Measure Sellers, and the agreement of the Measure Sellers not to compete with certain aspects of the business of Measure following the closing of the transaction. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is subject to: (i) the absence of a material adverse effect on Measure, (ii) the delivery by the parties of certain ancillary documents, and (iii) the execution by key employees of Measure of employment offer letters. Subject to certain limitations, each of the parties will be indemnified for damages resulting from third party claims and breaches of the parties’ respective representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement.
  The Shares issuable to the Measure Sellers pursuant to the Measure Purchase Agreement were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to a limited number of persons who are “accredited investors” or “sophisticated persons” as those terms are defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC, without the use of any general solicitation or advertising to market or otherwise offer the securities for sale. None of the Shares have been registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws, and none may be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration requirements.
  The fair value of the purchase consideration was allocated to the preliminary fair value of the net tangible assets acquired and to the separately identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the aggregate fair value of the net tangible assets and identified intangible assets has been treated as goodwill in accordance with ASC 805.

  Note 7 – Acquisition – Continued
  The Company has performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed. Using the total consideration for the Acquisition, the Company has estimated the allocations to such assets and liabilities.
  The preliminary purchase price allocation has been used to prepare pro forma adjustments in the pro forma balance sheet. The final purchase price allocation will be determined when the Company has completed the detailed valuations and necessary calculations. The final allocation could differ materially from the preliminary allocation used in the pro forma adjustments. The final allocation may include (1) changes in fair values of tangible assets; (2) changes in allocations to intangible assets such as trade names, developed technology and customer relationships, as well as goodwill; and (3) other changes to assets and liabilities.
  The following table summarizes the allocation of the preliminary purchase price as of the acquisition date of April 19, 2021:

  Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies
  Operating Leases
  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease terms at the commencement dates. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate for its leases, which is equal to the rate of interest the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The incremental borrowing rate for all existing leases as of the opening balance sheet date was based upon the remaining terms of the leases; the incremental borrowing rate for all new or amended leases is based upon the lease terms. The lease terms for all the Company’s leases include the contractually obligated period of the leases, plus any additional periods covered by options to extend the leases that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.
  Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in operating costs or General and administrative expense. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.
  The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less but greater than one month are not recorded on the balance sheet for select asset classes. The lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments as of the lease commencement date, or the opening balance sheet date for leases existing at adoption of Topic 842. The right-of-use asset recognized is based on the lease liability adjusted for prepaid and deferred rent and unamortized lease incentives.
  The Company has various operating leases, one of which is located at 8863 E. 34th Street North, Wichita, Kansas 67226, which serves as our corporate headquarters. The commencement date of the lease was November 1, 2020 and will expire on October 31, 2023, unless sooner terminated or extended. The second lease is for office space in Seattle, Washington under a noncancelable operating lease that expires in January 2026 with a 3% per year increase, and two months of abated rent for December 2020 and January 2021. Both leases are operating leases and included in the right-of-use asset, current portion of lease liability and long-term lease liability captions on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
  As a result of the Measure acquisition the Company acquired leases for office space in Washington, D.C., under a monthly operating lease expiring in September 2021 for Austin, Texas also under a monthly operating lease expiring December 2021 that are both less twelve months currently. The remaining lease payments due for these offices are $46,115.
  The aggregate estimated rent payments due over the initial three-to-six-year term is $1,374,097. Operating lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $1,078,676 as of June 30, 2021. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

  GreenBlock Capital LLC Consulting Agreement
  On May 3, 2019, we entered into a consulting agreement with GreenBlock Capital LLC (“Consultant”) to serve as strategic advisor and consultant with respect to the development of new business opportunities and the implementation of business strategies related to expansion into the emerging domestic hemp cultivation market. The extent of the services will be set forth in separate scopes of work, from time to time, to be prepared and mutually agreed to by the parties. As compensation for the services under the terms of the agreement, the Consultant can receive (i) $25,000 per month during the term of the agreement, (ii) 500,000 shares of restricted Common Stock upon execution of the agreement and up to (iii) up to 2,500,000 shares of restricted Common Stock upon the achievement of predetermined milestones.
    On October 31, 2019, the consulting agreement was terminated as a result of the Company no longer needing these services to be provided by an outside consultant.
  The Company has settled with the Consultant. The Consultant made a demand for an additional 750,000 shares of common stock to be issued. Although the Company disputed that the milestones were successfully achieved by the Consultant and believed that no additional shares of Common Stock were owed, the Company has offered and the Consultant has accepted, in the form of a settlement, a total of 550,000 additional shares of Common Stock issued on May 17, 2021. On March 31, 2021, the Company recorded additional stock compensation expense within general & administrative expenses in the amount of $1,407,000 based upon the fair market value of $4.69 per share of the Company’s Common Stock as of May 12, 2021, resulting in a liability amount of $2,907,000 for purposes of payment of the settlement.

  Valqari Agreement
  On October 14, 2020, in connection with, and as an incentive to the entry into a two-year exclusive manufacturing agreement to produce a patented Drone Delivery Station for Valqari, the Company entered into a Convertible Promissory Note (see Note 4).
  Also on October 14, 2020, AgEagle entered into a manufacturing agreement with Valqari for the manufacture and assembly of Valqari’s patented Drone Delivery Station, in accordance with the specifications provided by, and the components designated by Valqari, for sale and delivery to its customers. AgEagle was appointed as Valqari’s exclusive manufacturer of its products in the United States of America for a term of two-years, unless terminated earlier. Valqari, based in Chicago, Illinois, is engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a patented Drone Delivery Station, including related software.
  In June 2021, AgEagle gave notice of termination of the manufacturing agreement for cause based on material defects in the specifications and other information provided by Valqari, and without cause as otherwise permitted in the agreement.  Valqari disputes the allegations of breach, but AgEagle believe that Valqari has in effect consented to termination of the agreement, with both parties reserving their rights to claim damages based on alleged past breaches.  AgEagle has claimed that Valqari owes $43,945 for two outstanding invoices from AgEagle for units built and delivered, as well as additional amounts for two units as to which Valqari has refused to take delivery.
  AgEagle has also demanded payment of the note, including accrued interest; based on the initial maturity date of April 14, 2021; however, Valqari has alleged that the note’s maturity date was extended to October 14, 2021.  AgEagle disputes this extension; however, for practical reasons AgEagle intends to wait until October in order to pursue collection actions, if necessary.

  Company Overview
  AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle,” “the Company,” “us,” “we,” “our”) through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class drones, sensors, and software that solve important problems for our customers.  Founded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-winged drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry.  Today, our Company is earning distinction as a globally respected, industry leader offering best-in-class, full stack drone solutions to a wide range of industries, including energy, construction, agriculture and government.  AgEagle is led by a proven management team with years of drone industry experience.   Through participation on the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Drone Advisory Committee and the FAA’s BEYOND program, AgEagle is helping to establish entirely new rulemaking guidelines and regulations for the future of autonomous flight and the full integration of drones into the U.S. airspace. 
   In the first half of 2019, the Company introduced HempOverview™, a scalable, responsive and cost-effective Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) web- and map-based technology platform to support the operations of domestic industrial hemp programs for state and tribal nation departments of agriculture – a solution that provides users with what the Company believes is the gold standard for regulatory oversight, operational assistance and reporting capabilities for the fast emerging industrial hemp industry. 
    In January 2021, AgEagle acquired MicaSense™, Inc. (“MicaSense”), based in Seattle, Washington. MicaSense has been at the forefront of advanced drone sensor development since its founding in 2014, having formed integration partnerships with several leading fixed wing and multirotor drone manufacturers. MicaSense’s patented, high precision thermal and multispectral sensors serve the aerial mapping and analytics needs of the agriculture market. MicaSense’s high performance proprietary products, including Altum™, RedEdge-MX™, RedEdge-MX™ Blue and Atlas Flight, have global distribution in over 70 countries. 
    In April 2021, AgEagle acquired Measure Global, Inc. (“Measure”), a company founded in 2020 with business operations in Washington, D.C. and Austin, Texas.  Serving a world class customer base, Measure enables its customers to realize the transformative benefits of drone technology through its Ground Control solution. Offered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Ground Control is a cloud-based, plug-and-play operating system that empowers pilots and large enterprises with everything they need to operate drone fleets, fly autonomously, collaborate globally, visualize data, and integrate with existing business systems and processes.
     We intend to grow our business and preserve our leadership position by developing new drones, sensors and software and capturing a significant share of the global drone market.  In addition, we expect to accelerate our growth and expansion through strategic acquisitions of companies offering distinct technological and competitive advantages and have defensible IP protection in place, if applicable.  
    The Company is headquartered in Wichita, Kansas with business operations and several offices located throughout the United States.  
  33
    Key Growth Strategies
  Our near- and mid-term growth strategies are centered on designing high performance, full stack drone solutions for customers in a broad range of industries, including energy, construction,agriculture and government. We aim to define a new world in which autonomous drones play a key role in making businesses more efficient, infrastructure safer and people more connected.
Key components of our growth strategy include the following:
    ● Delivering new and innovative solutions. AgEagle’s research and development efforts are the foundation of the Company, and we intend to continue investing in our own innovations, pioneering new and enhanced products and solutions that enable us to exceed the expectations of our customers. AgEagle believes that by investing in research and development, the Company can be a leader in delivering innovative drones, sensors and software that address applications and needs within our current target verticals, enabling us to create new opportunities for growth.
        ● Pursuing new business opportunities outside of our legacy focus on agriculture as we continue to expand and grow AgEagle’s full stack solutions. We intend to grow our business and preserve our leadership position by developing new drones, sensors and software and capturing a significant share of the global drone market.  We are confident that the efficiencies and value which we have endeavored to provide our customers in the agriculture industry can be expanded to an increasing number of customers in the energy, construction and government verticals.
        ● Achieving greater market penetration of the U.S. industrial hemp industry.  We are working to establish HempOverview software platform as the gold industry standard for hemp cultivation oversight, compliance, enforcement and commerce. AgEagle is leveraging best-in-class technology to provide a solution for state and tribal regulatory departments of agriculture, industrial hemp and hemp-derived CBD growers and processors. At this time, AgEagle believes that it is the only company in the nation with extensive experience in agriculture that is effectively addressing the emerging needs and challenges of the domestic hemp cultivation industry.
        ● Growth through acquisition. Through successful execution of our growth-through-acquisition strategies, we intend to acquire technologically advanced companies and intellectual property that complement and strengthen our value proposition to the market. We believe that by investing in complementary acquisitions, we can accelerate our revenue growth and deliver a broader array of innovative drone systems and solutions that address specialized market needs within our current target markets and in emerging drone industry sectors.  
  Competitive Strengths
  AgEagle believes the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
    ● Proprietary technologies, in-house capabilities and industry experience. We believe our eleven years of experience in commercial drone design and engineering; in-house manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities; and advanced technology development serve to differentiate AgEagle in the marketplace. As of today, we develop and manufacture our products and software in the United States. Also, through our acquisitions of MicaSense and Measure, we have added people to the AgEagle team with dozens of years of experience operating in the global drone industry with unique insights into regulations and how to operationalize drones and scale their use for enterprise customers.
  34
      ● Advanced technology solutions allow users to remove the guesswork in effectively managing hemp cultivation oversight, compliance, enforcement, reporting and commerce. To our knowledge, there is no other SaaS solution available on the market today – particularly one that has been developed by a proven Agtech company with the level of experience and expertise of AgEagle – that provides the multi-faceted level of support and services that HempOverview offers to all stakeholders in the industry.
        ● AgEagle is a respected industry pioneer helping to establish entirely new standards of rule for the future of autonomous flight. Through our active advocacy efforts and direct involvement with government- and industry-sponsored agencies and organizations, AgEagle’s leadership team remains at the forefront of shaping the rulemaking guidelines and regulations that will make autonomous flight of unmanned aerial systems safe, reliable and accessible to more businesses worldwide.
        ● Through our wholly owned subsidiary MicaSense, AgEagle offers branded multispectral and thermal sensor solutions that provides users with unparalleled operational efficiency, collecting and outputting multiple data sets which provide actionable intelligence to its customers. From farmers to scientists to researchers, MicaSense sensors are relied upon for computer-aided analysis of data to detect crop disease, crop stress, field moisture conditions, weed populations and other factors.
        ● Through our wholly owned subsidiary Measure Global and its proprietary Ground Control aerial intelligence solution, AgEagle provides customers with the ability to capitalize on significant economic, safety and efficiency benefits made possible by drones used at scale. With end-to-end program management, user-friendly flight control, and in-platform data analysis, Ground Control helps our customers save thousands of hazardous man-hours and create millions of dollars in operational benefits.
  Impact of COVID-19 On Our Business Operations
  The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has spread to many regions of the world, including the United States. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.
  Should the coronavirus continue to spread, our business operations could be delayed or interrupted. For instance, we currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture components and parts for the proprietary and contracted drones we produce, and to perform quality testing. We also manufacture and assemble products and perform various services at our manufacturing facility. If either we or any third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and assemble products.
  The spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought on by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruptions of global financial markets, which may reduce our future ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our Common Stock.
  The ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations in the future. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.
  35
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
  Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence, accounting for stock-based awards, and income taxes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
  We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Please see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, which are included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report, for our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements.
  Results of Operations
  For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 as Compared to the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2020
  For the three months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded revenues of $1,937,364 compared to revenues of $16,325 for the same period in 2020, a 11,767% increase. The increase was mainly due to new revenues derived from the acquisition of MicaSense business related specifically to sensor sales for the Red Edge and Altum. Revenue growth was also positively impacted by increased sales of our HempOverview platform to the State of Iowa and Florida. Lastly the increase in revenue was also impacted by the Measure acquisition, which accounted for subscription sales related to the Ground Control platform. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded revenues of $3,638,955 compared to revenues of $407,605 for the same period in 2020, an 793% increase. The increase was largely due to new revenues derived from the acquisition of MicaSense specifically to sensor sales along with the acquisition of the Measure business.and continued growth from our HempOverview platform sales.
  During the three months ended June 30, 2021, cost of sales totaled $959,229, a $944,199, or 6,282%, increase when compared to $15,030 in the three months ended June 30, 2020. Costs of sales totaled $1,658,097 and $188,633, for the six months ended June 30,2021 and 2020, respectively, reflecting an increase in our cost of goods sold of 779%. We had a gross profit of $978,135, or 50% gross profit margin, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $1,295, or 8% gross profit margin, for the three months ended June 30, 2020. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, we had a gross profit of $1,980,858 or 54% and $218,972 or 54%, respectively, an increase in our profit margins of 805%. The primary factors contributing to the increase in our cost of sales and gross profit margin was due to increase in our sales volume along with continued shift in mix of products we offer customers in the new markets we serve that have resulted in higher margin for our sales specifically for our sensor sales related to MicaSense acquisition and SaaS offerings.
  We recorded total operating expenses of $5,798,620 during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a 361% increase as compared to operating expenses of $1,256,663 in the same period of 2020. Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative expenses, professional fees, research and development and sales and marketing expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $4,062,800 during the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $721,705 in the same period of 2020, an increase of 463%. The increase was primarily due to costs for additional payroll and bonus payments associated with new hires and existing employees for the MicaSense and Measure acquisitions, and stock compensation expenses related to employees and directors, expenses related to annual shareholders meeting, rent cost associated to the new leases for Wichita, Seattle, Washington D.C. and Austin offices, and additional amortization expense associated to the intangibles acquired as part of the recent acquisitions and platform development costs. Professional fees decreased 50% as we had $268,987 of expenses for the current period versus $532,406 in the comparable prior period mainly because of the termination of GreenBlock consulting agreement. Also included in operating expenses was sales and marketing costs that increased 21,837% to $559,833 versus $2,522 in the prior year’s comparable period due to the addition of the MicaSense and Measure sales and marketing teams and the hiring of a new Director of Marketing. Lastly, we recorded research and development expenses totaled $907,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2021, no expenses were recorded for the same period during 2020, the increase was due to the MicaSense and Measure acquisitions costs incurred for the development of new sensor products and software maintenance costs.

    We recorded total operating expenses of $9,762,146 and $1,877,613, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, a 420% increase. Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative costs, professional fees, research and development and sales and marketing expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $5,681,928 and $1,161,066 in general and administrative expenses, respectively, resulting in a 389% increase. The increase was primarily due to costs for additional payroll and bonus payments associated with new hires and existing employees for the MicaSense and Measure acquisitions, and stock compensation expenses related to employees and directors, expenses related to annual shareholders meeting, rent cost associated to the new leases for Wichita, Seattle, Washington D.C. and Austin offices, additional amortization expense associated to the intangibles acquired as part of the recent acquisitions and platform development costs and added costs associated to financial audits, tax and valuation services. Professional fees also increased 178% as we had $1,953,186 of expenses for the current period versus $703,904 in the comparable prior period mainly due to stock-based compensation associated with the termination of the GreenBlock Capital agreement. Also included in our operating expenses was sales and marketing costs that increased 6,160% to $791,427 versus $12,643 in the prior comparable period due to addition of the MicaSense and Measure sales and marketing teams and the hiring of a new Director of Marketing. Lastly, we recorded research and development expenses totaled $1,335,605 during the six months ended June 30, 2021, no expenses were recorded for the same period during 2020, the increase was due to the MicaSense and Measure acquisitions costs incurred for the development of new sensor products and software products.  
  Other income (expense) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, was $31,329 and $58,751, respectively there was no other income(expense) recorded for the comparable periods during 2020. The majority of the increase represented the forgiveness of the PPP loan for AgEagle offset by loss on disposal of fixed assets.
  Our net loss was $4,678,172 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. This represents a $3,422,804 increase over our net loss of $1,255,368 in the same period during 2020. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we had a net loss of $7,608,702 and $1,658,641 respectively, an increase of $5,950,061 or 359%. Overall, the increase in net loss is due to greater operating costs mostly within general and administrative costs along with added professional and research and development costs because of the shift in our sales and long-term growth strategies that required increased resources and investments to support our growth and acquisition strategies. We are in the process of continuing to address these shifts by developing new platforms, products and services that support prevailing growth opportunities in the full stack drone solutions market.
  For the three months ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, our net loss available to common stockholders was $4,678,172 and $10,326,250, respectively, a decrease of $5,648,078. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, our net loss available to common stockholders was $7,608,702 and $10,769,968, respectively, a decrease of $3,161,266. The net loss available to common stockholders decrease during this period compared to the prior period was due to Series D Preferred Stock dividends recorded during the period of June 2020, non-cash charges stemming from required deemed dividend accounting for modifications to certain preferred stock, redemption of preferred stock and the trigger of down round provisions on certain preferred stock and warrants.

    Cash Flows
  June 30, 2021 As Compared to June 30, 2020
  Cash on hand was $39,214,638 on June 30, 2021, an increase of $26,306,925 compared to the $12,907,713 on hand at June 30, 2020. Cash used in operations for the six months ended June 30,2021 was $3,506,235 compared to $710,679 of cash used by operations for the same period during 2020. The increase in cash used in operating activities was driven mainly driven by an increase in operating loss due to greater overhead expenses along with an increase in accrued expenses related to issuance of common stock and accrued liabilities for the MicaSense and Measure acquisitions.
  Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $24,561,757, compared to $6,173 during the same period during 2020. The increase in cash used in our investing activities resulted from the acquisitions of MicaSense and Measure, purchase of property and equipment and building improvements related to the new leased warehouse and corporate offices in Wichita, along with recording capitalized costs associated with the development of the HempOverview platform.
  Cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $43,342,297, which compared to $12,906,568 cash used in financing activities during the same period of 2020. The increase in cash provided by our financing activities was due to sales of our Common Stock and the exercise of warrants issued in connection with a securities purchase agreement executed in August 2020.
  Liquidity and Capital Resources
   As of June 30, 2021, we had working capital of $34,068,995 and a loss from operations of $7,608,702 for the period then ended. While there can be no guarantees, we believe cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from revenue, will be sufficient to fund the next year of operations. In addition, we intend to pursue other opportunities of raising capital with outside investors.
  During 2021, we raised capital of $6,313,943 as a result of the sale of 1,057,214 shares of Common Stock in connection with a securities purchase agreement (the “December Purchase Agreement”) entered on December 31, 2020. Also on February 8, 2021, we received $8,305,368 in additional gross proceeds associated with the exercise of 2,516,778 of warrants issued at a price of $3.30 in connection with a securities purchase agreement dated August 4, 2020.
  During the period from May 29, 2021, through June 30, 2021, we raised approximately $28,647,161 by utilizing our ATM Offering with co-agents Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Raymond James & Associates.
  We continue to realize losses from operations. However, as a result of our capital raise efforts, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through December 2022. Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, and for general corporate purposes. Our primary source of liquidity is funds generated by financing activities and from private placements. Our ability to fund our operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to make planned acquisitions, to make scheduled debt payments, and to repay or refinance indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
  38
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
  On June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
  Inflation
  Our opinion is that inflation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our operations.
  Climate Change
  Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.
  New Accounting Pronouncements
  There were various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

    ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
  As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.
  ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, and in light of the material weakness in internal controls described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective as of June 30, 2021.
  Our internal control over financial reporting did not result in the accurate recording of revenues, costs of goods sold and other operating expenses for the period ended March 31, 2021. Therefore internal controls over financial reporting were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures. A controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(t) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the three-month period ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s management is in the process of the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting.

    PART II OTHER INFORMATION
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
  Legal Proceedings
  From time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
