NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 AND 2022
(UNAUDITED)
  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation
  Description of Business – AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle” or the “Company”, “our”, “we”, or “us”), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AgEagle Aerial, Inc., DBA MicaSense™, Inc. (“MicaSense”), Measure Global, Inc. (“Measure”), senseFly SA and senseFly Inc. (collectively “senseFly”), is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class drones, sensors and software that solve important problems for its customers in a wide range of industry verticals, including energy/utilities, infrastructure, agriculture and government.
  Founded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-winged drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. Today, the Company is earning distinction as a globally respected market leader offering customer-centric, advanced, autonomous unmanned aerial systems (“UAS”) which drive revenue at the intersection of flight hardware, sensors and software for industries that include agriculture, military/defense, public safety, surveying/mapping and utilities/engineering, among others. AgEagle has also achieved numerous regulatory firsts, including earning governmental approvals for its commercial and tactical drones to fly Beyond Visual Line of Sight (“BVLOS”) and/or Operations Over People (“OOP”) in the United States, Canada, Brazil and the European Union.
  AgEagle’s shift and expansion from solely manufacturing fixed-wing farm drones in 2018, to offering what the Company believes is one of the industry’s best fixed-wing, full-stack drone solutions, culminated in 2021 when the Company acquired three market-leading companies engaged in producing UAS airframes, sensors and software for commercial and government use. In addition to a robust portfolio of proprietary, connected hardware and software products; an established global network of over 200 UAS resellers; and enterprise customers worldwide; these acquisitions also brought AgEagle a workforce comprised largely of experienced engineers and technologists with deep expertise in the fields of robotics, automation, manufacturing and data science. In 2022, the Company succeeded in integrating all three acquired companies with AgEagle to form one global company focused on taking autonomous flight performance to a higher level.
  The business acquisitions completed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2021 of 100% of the outstanding stock of MicaSense, Measure and senseFly, respectively, are collectively referred to as the “2021 Business Acquisitions.”
  The Company is currently headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, where it houses its sensor manufacturing operations and Lausanne, Switzerland where it operates its drone manufacturing operations.
  Basis of Presentation – The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the Company has made all necessary adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, for a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. Certain information and disclosures included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 4, 2023. The results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, any other interim periods or any future year or periods.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 AND 2022
(UNAUDITED)
  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation - Continued
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AgEagle and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AgEagle Aerial, Inc.; Measure Global, Inc.; senseFly S.A. and senseFly Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
  A description of certain of the Company’s accounting policies and other financial information is included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
  Liquidity and Going Concern – In pursuit of the Company’s long-term growth strategy and acquisitions, the Company has sustained continued operating losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $17,910,210 and used cash in operating activities of $8,829,669. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has working capital of $2,818,220 and an accumulated deficit of $134,374,548. While the Company has historically been successful in raising capital to meet its working capital needs, the ability to continue raising such capital is not guaranteed. There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as the Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations for twelve (12) months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. The Company is evaluating strategies to obtain the required additional funding for future operations and the restructuring of operations to grow revenues and reduce expenses.
  If the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
  Risks and Uncertainties – Global economic challenges, including the impact of war, pandemics, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions and adverse labor market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The aforementioned risks and their respective impacts on the UAV industry and the Company’s operational and financial performance remain uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. Specifically, because of the aforementioned continuing risks, the Company’s ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, the Company’s supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products.
  Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the reserve for obsolete inventory, valuation of stock issued for services and stock options, valuation of intangible assets, valuation of goodwill, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.

FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 AND 2022
(UNAUDITED)
  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures – Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), requires companies to determine fair value based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.
  The guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
  ● Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
    ● Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
    ● Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
  For short-term classes of our financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, their carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The outstanding loans related to the COVID Loans and promissory note are carried at face value, which approximates fair value. As of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis.
  Inventories – Inventories, which consist of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined by the average-cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials and direct labor. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation primarily includes an analysis of forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, among consideration of other factors. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. Based upon the evaluation, provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company’s estimates and expectations.
  Cash Concentrations – The Company maintains its cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company has significant cash balances at financial institutions which throughout the year regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
  Revenue Recognition and Concentration – Most of the Company’s revenues are derived primarily through the sales of drones, sensors and related accessories, and software subscriptions. All contracts and agreements are at fixed prices and are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
  The Company generally recognizes revenue on sales to customers, dealers, and distributors upon satisfaction of performance obligations which generally occurs once controls transfer to customers, which is when product is shipped or delivered depending on specific shipping terms and, where applicable, a customer acceptance has been obtained. The fee is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved. The Company records revenue in the statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) net of any sales, use, value added, or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions and net of any discounts, allowances and returns.
  The Company’s software subscriptions to its platforms, HempOverview and Ground Control, are offered on a subscription basis. These subscription fees are recognized equally over the membership period as the services are provided.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Additionally, customer payments received in advance of the Company completing performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities. Customer deposits represent customer prepayments and are recognized as revenue when the term of the sale or performance obligation is completed. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, contract liabilities represent $329,536 and $496,390.
  Internal-use Software Costs – Internal-use software costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as research and development costs as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software (typically three to five years). Maintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company reviews the carrying value for impairment whenever facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. Amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs is included in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
  As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, capitalized software costs for internal-use software related to the Company’s implementation of its enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software, totaled $640,448 and $721,795, respectively, net of accumulated amortization and are included in intangible assets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company placed its ERP into service on May 1, 2022.
  Further, capitalized software costs for internal-use software include costs incurred in connection with our HempOverview and Ground Control which we offer to our customers under SaaS arrangements. We account for these capitalized development costs in accordance with ASC 350-40 as our customer do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty nor is it feasible for our customers to run the hosted software on their own. As of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, capitalized software development costs for our hosted platforms, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1,100,734 and $1,332,516, respectively, and are included in intangible assets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets – The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from four to five years.
  As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the goodwill balance was $21,679,411 and $23,179,411, respectively. The Company tests its goodwill for impairment, at least annually, unless events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, the Company may look to perform such test sooner versus on an annual basis. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in the Company’s market capitalization, decline in operating performance indicators, competition, or a reorganization of our business. The Company’s goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the business segment. The level at which the Company test goodwill for impairment requires it to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results which is referred to as a reporting unit.
  We use a quantitative approach when testing goodwill. To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to it’s carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds it’s carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples.

  Due to a significant decline in our market capitalization and overall economic conditions, as well as the performance of the business, during the third quarter of 2023 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test at September 30, 2023 on both our reporting units that had goodwill balances recorded, SaaS and Sensors. Based on this analysis, we concluded that the carrying value of the SaaS reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1,500,000 for this excess at September 30, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $41,687,871 on two impaired reporting units, SaaS and Drones.
  Our goodwill balance, after the impairment, of approximately $21.7 million is allocated to our Sensors and SaaS reporting units as follows: $19 million and $2.7 million, respectively.
  As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our intangible assets balance was $9,242,659 and $11,507,653, respectively. Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from five to ten years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.
  As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company deemed that no impairment was indicated for the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible assets.
  Foreign Currency – The Company translates assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiary, senseFly S.A., predominately in Swiss Franc to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company translates the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) of its foreign subsidiary at average exchange rates for the applicable period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, arising primarily from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated revenues, certain purchases and intercompany transactions are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
  Shipping Costs – All shipping costs billed directly to the customer are directly offset to shipping costs resulting in a net expense to the Company, which is included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, shipping costs totaled $68,966 and $75,074, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, shipping costs totaled $191,447 and $220,049, respectively.
  Advertising Costs – Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and presented in sales and marketing expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, advertising costs were $44,701 and $139,480, respectively; and for the nine months ended were $113,119 and $303,862, respectively.
  Vendor Concentrations – As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was one significant vendor that the Company relies upon to perform certain services for the Company’s technology platform. This vendor provides services to the Company, which can be replaced by alternative vendors should the need arise.
  Loss Per Common Share and Potentially Dilutive Securities – Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus Common Stock, par value $0.001 (“Common Stock”) equivalents (if dilutive) related to warrants, options, and convertible instruments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has excluded all common equivalent shares outstanding for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and options to purchase Common Stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, because these securities are anti-dilutive for the periods presented. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had 419,722 unvested RSUs, 2,777,732 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock and 48,351,747 common stock warrants, and 6,275 of Series F Preferred Stock convertible into 25,100,000 shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had 629,367 unvested RSUs, 2,484,373 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock and 6,311 shares of Series F Preferred Stock convertible into 10,179,032 shares of Common Stock, and 16,129,032 Common Stock warrants.

  Segment Reporting – In accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, (“ASC 280”), the Company identifies operating segments as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company defines the term “chief operating decision maker” to be its chief executive officer.
  The Company has determined that it operates in four segments:
    ● Drones, which comprises revenues earned from contractual arrangements to develop, manufacture and /or modify complex drone related products, and to provide associated engineering, technical and other services according to customer specifications.
        ● Sensors, which comprises the revenue earned through the sale of sensors, cameras, and related accessories.
        ● SaaS, which comprises revenue earned through the offering of online-based subscriptions.
        ● Corporate, which comprises corporate costs only.
  New Accounting Pronouncements – In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), which addresses areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of its previously issued credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13, that introduced the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires a public business entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables and net investment in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. ASU 2022-02 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and for periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 effective January 1, 2023 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future condensed consolidated financial statements.

  Note 4 – Notes Receivable
  Valqari
  On October 14, 2020, in connection with, and as an incentive to the entry into a two-year exclusive manufacturing agreement (the “Manufacturing Agreement”) to produce a patented Drone Delivery Station for Valqari, LLC (“Valqari), the Company entered into, as payee, a Convertible Promissory Note pursuant to which the Company made a loan to Valqari in the principal aggregate amount of $500,000 (the “Note”). The Note accrues interest at a rate of three percent per annum.
  The Note matured on April 15, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time all outstanding principal and interest that had accrued, but remained, unpaid was due. The Note provides for an automatic six-month extension of the Maturity Date under the following circumstances (i) Valqari has received in writing, (x) a good faith acquisition offer at a consideration value greater than $15,000,000, (y) such offer, upon consummation, would result in a change in control (as defined in the note) of Valqari, and (z) at such time Valqari, is actively engaged in the negotiation or finalization of such acquisition transaction; or (ii) Valqari has initiated, or is in the process of initiating, a conversion to a “C-Corporation” under the Internal Revenue Code, whereas such conversion will be completed no later than one day prior to the extended Maturity Date. Valqari was not permitted to prepay the Note prior to the Maturity Date.
  The Note is subject to customary representations and warranties by Valqari, as well as events of default, which may lead to acceleration of the payment of the Note such as (i) failure to pay all of the outstanding principal, plus accrued interest on the Maturity Date or Extended Maturity Date, (ii) Valqari filing a petition or action under any bankruptcy, or other law, or (iii) an involuntary petition is filed again Valqari under any bankruptcy statute (that is not dismissed or discharged within 60 days). The indebtedness evidenced by the Note is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of any senior indebtedness (as defined in the Note) in existence on the date of the Note or incurred thereafter.
  On the Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest, however, Valqari alleged that the Maturity Date was automatically extended to October 14, 2021 (“Extended Maturity Date”), for an additional six months. Upon the Extended Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest; however, Valqari sought a substantial discount on the amount due under the Note to compensate for alleged breaches by AgEagle under the Manufacturing Agreement. AgEagle disputes the allegations of breach and believes that it is owed a net amount by Valqari under the Manufacturing Agreement, in addition to the amount due under the Note. On November 24, 2021, Valqari made a payment of principal on the Note of $315,000. The parties are continuing to negotiate in an attempt to reach an amicable resolution of their disputes; however, AgEagle reserves the right to take legal action to collect the Note in the event that a settlement is not reached.

As of senseFly Acquisition Date, the fair value of the COVID Loan was $1,440,046 (“senseFly COVID Loans”). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, senseFly S.A. made the required payments on the senseFly COVID Loans, including principal and accrued interest, aggregating approximately $87,052 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, no payments of principal and interest were required. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s outstanding obligations under the senseFly COVID Loans are $815,906. On August 25, 2023, the Company modified one (1) its existing agreements to extend the repayment period of the COVID Loan from a maturity date of December 2023 to June 2025. The other COVID loan remains unchanged.
  As of September 30, 2023, scheduled principal payments due under the senseFly COVID Loans are as follows:
  Year ending December 31,

  Note 6 – Promissory Note and Warrant
  On December 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Promissory Note Purchase Agreement”) with an institutional investor (the “Investor”) which is an existing shareholder of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Promissory Note Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue to the Investor (i) an 8% original issue discount promissory note (the “Note”) in the aggregate principal amount of $3,500,000, and (ii) a common stock purchase warrant (the “Promissory Note Warrant”) to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Shares”) at an exercise price of $0.44 per share, subject to standard anti-dilution adjustments. The Note is an unsecured obligation of the Company. It has an original issue discount of 4% and bears interest at 8% per annum. The Company received net proceeds of $3,285,000 net of the original issue discount of $140,000 and $75,000 of issuance costs. The Promissory Note Warrant was not exercisable for the first six months after issuance and had a five-year term from the initial exercise date of June 6, 2023.
  The Company determined the estimated fair value of the common stock warrants issued with the Note to be $1,847,200 using a Black-Scholes pricing model. In accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt, the Company recorded a discount of $1,182,349 on the Note based on the relative fair value of the warrants and total proceeds. At Note issuance, the Company recorded a total discount on the debt of $1,397,350 comprised of the relative fair value of the warrants, the original issue discount, and the issuance costs. The aggregate discount was being amortized into interest expense over the approximate two-year term of the Note. The Company used the following assumptions in determining the fair value of the warrants: expected term of five years, volatility rate of 135.8%, risk free rate of 3.73%, and dividend rate of 0%.
  Beginning June 1, 2023, and on the first business day of each month thereafter, the Company shall pay 1/20th ($175,000) of the original principal amount (the “Monthly Amortization Payments”) of the Note plus any accrued but unpaid interest, with any remaining principal plus accrued interest payable in full upon the maturity date of December 31, 2024 or the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Note). In addition, to the extent the Company raises any equity capital (by private placement, public offering or otherwise), the Company shall utilize 50% of the net proceeds from such equity financing to prepay the Note, within two business days of the Company’s receipt of such funds. In the event such equity financing is provided by the Investor, pursuant to the terms of that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as June 26, 2022, or otherwise (an “Additional Investment”), the Investor shall agree to accept 50% less warrant coverage in connection with such Additional Investment, up to $3,300,000 of such Additional Investment.

  Note 6 – Promissory Note and Warrant – Continued
  On August 14, 2023, the Company and Investor entered into a Note Amendment Agreement due to the Company not making the Monthly Amortization Payments for the months of June – August 2023. Pursuant to the Note Amendment Agreement, the parties agreed to amend the Note as follows:
    (i) defer payment of the Monthly Amortization Payments for June 2023, July 2023 and August 2023 in the aggregate amount of $525,000 (the “Deferred Payments”), and the September Monthly Amortization Payment, in the amount of $175,000, until September 15, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Deferred Payments per the terms of the Amended Note were not made (see below).
        (ii) increase the principal amount of the Note by $595,000 so that the current principal amount of the Note is $4,095,000.
  The Note Amendment Agreement resulted in a debt extinguishment due to the modified terms of the Note being substantially different than the original terms primarily due to the substantial increase in principal of $595,000. In accordance with ASC 470-50-40-2, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $1,523,867 for the difference between the reacquisition price of the debt, of $4,095,000 and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt of $2,571,133 comprised of $3,500,000 of principal less $928,867 of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs on the original debt.
  On September 15, 2023, the Company and Investor entered into a Warrant Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investor 5,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for the Warrant for no consideration. The Company accounted for the incremental value of the Promissory Note Warrant modification of $190,500 as an increase in additional paid-in capital and interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

  Alpha has the right, subject to certain conditions, including shareholder approval, which was obtained on February 3, 2023, to purchase up to $25,000,000 of additional shares of Series F and Series F Warrants (collectively the “Series F Option”). The Series F Option will be available for a period of eighteen months after such shareholder approval at a purchase price equal to the average of the volume weighted average price for three trading days prior to the date that Alpha gives notice to the Company that it will exercise the Series F Option.
  Commencing from the Series F Closing Date and for a period of six months thereafter, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, indebtedness or a combination of units thereof (a “Subsequent Financing”), Alpha will have the right to participate in up to an amount of the Subsequent Financing equal to 50% of the Subsequent Financing on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent Financing. Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except that the Company shall not undertake certain corporate actions as set forth in the Certificate of Designation that would materially impact the holders of Preferred Stock without their consent.
  On December 6, 2022, upon the issuance of the promissory note and common stock warrants with an exercise price of $0.44 (see Note 6), a down round or anti-dilution trigger event occurred resulting in the conversion rate on the Series F and the exercise price of the Series F Warrants issued with the Series F adjusting down to $0.44 from $0.62 and $0.96, respectively (the “December Down Round Trigger”). The December Down Round Trigger resulted in the Company recognizing a deemed dividend on the common stock warrants and Series F of $565,161 and $1,680,216, respectively, or aggregate deemed dividend of $2,245,377, for the incremental value to the warrant and Series F holder resulting from the reduction in exercise price and conversion price.
  The deemed dividend on the Series F Warrants represents the difference between fair value of the Series F Warrants under the original terms before the December Down Round Trigger and the fair value of the Series F Warrants after December Down Round Trigger at the reduced exercise price. The fair value of the Series F Warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions: expected life of 3 years, volatility of 150%, risk free rate of 3.77%, and dividend rate of 0%.
  On March 9, 2023, the Company received an Investor Notice from Alpha to purchase an additional 3,000 shares of Series F Convertible Preferred (the “Additional Series F Preferred”). Each share of Additional Series F Preferred is convertible into 2,381 shares of the Company’s Common Stock per $1,000 Stated Value per share of Series F Preferred Stock, at a conversion price of $0.42 per share and associated common stock warrants to purchase up to 7,142,715 shares of Common Stock at the exercise price of $0.42 per share warrant (the “Additional Warrant”) for an aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000. The Additional Warrant is exercisable upon issuance and has a three-year term. On March 10, 2023, the Company issued and sold the Additional Series F Preferred and the Additional Warrant.
  As a result of issuing the additional 3,000 shares of Series F Convertible Preferred, a down round or anti-dilution trigger event occurred, resulting in the conversion rate on the Series F and the exercise price of the Series F Warrants issued with the Series F adjusting down to $0.42 from $0.44 (the “March Down Round Trigger”). The March Down Round Trigger resulted in the Company recognizing a deemed dividend on the common stock warrants and Series F Preferred Stock of $38,226 and $217,750, respectively, or aggregate deemed dividend of $255,976, for the incremental value to the warrant and Series F holder resulting from the reduction in exercise price and conversion price.
  The deemed dividend on the Series F Warrants represents the difference between fair value of the Series F Warrants under the original terms before the March Down Round Trigger and the fair value of the Series F Warrants after March Down Round Trigger at the reduced exercise price. The fair value of the Series F Warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions: expected life of 3 years, volatility of 131%, risk free rate of 4.46%, and dividend rate of 0%.

The June Down Round Trigger resulted in the Company recognizing a deemed dividend on the common stock warrants and Series F Preferred Stock of $787,823 and $3,867,095, respectively, or an aggregate deemed dividend of $4,654,918, for the incremental value to the warrant and Series F holder resulting from the reduction in exercise price and conversion price.
  The deemed dividend on the Series F Warrants represents the difference between fair value of the Series F Warrants under the original terms before the down round trigger and the fair value of the Series F Warrants after down round trigger at the reduced exercise price. The fair value of the Series F Warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions: expected life of 2.5 years, volatility of 106%, risk free rate of 4.28%, and dividend rate of 0%.

  Note 8 – Leases
  Operating Leases
  In May 2023, the Company executed a sublease agreement for their facility located in Seattle, Washington; however, the Company remains the primary obligor under the original lease. The sublease commenced June 1, 2023 and requires a total of $433,137 rental payments over a thirty-two-month term. Due to the anticipated sublease income being less than the total rental payments required on the primary lease, we recorded an impairment charge on the right-of-use asset associated with this lease of $79,287 which has been included on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a lease impairment charge which is included in “Impairment” on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss (income). During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $24,284 of rental income on the straight-line basis as an offset to rent expenses within general and administrative expenses.

  Overview
  AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle”, “Company”, “We”, “Our”, “Us”), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class drones, sensors and software that solve important problems for our customers. Founded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-winged drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. AgEagle’s shift and expansion from solely manufacturing fixed-wing farm drones in 2018, to offering what we believe is one of the industry’s best fixed-wing, full-stack drone solutions, culminated in 2021 when we acquired three market-leading companies engaged in producing UAS airframes, sensors and software for commercial and government use. In addition to a robust portfolio of proprietary, connected hardware and software products; an established global network of over 200 UAS resellers; and enterprise customers worldwide; these acquisitions also brought AgEagle a highly valuable workforce comprised largely of experienced engineers and technologists with deep expertise in the fields of robotics, automation, manufacturing and data science. In 2022, we succeeded in integrating all three acquired companies with AgEagle to form one global company focused on taking autonomous flight performance to a higher level.
  AgEagle has also achieved numerous regulatory firsts, earning governmental approvals for its commercial and tactical drones to fly Beyond Visual Line of Sight (“BVLOS”) and/or Operations Over People (“OOP”) in the United States, Canada, Brazil and the European Union.
  AgEagle is led by a proven management team with years of drone industry experience and is currently headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, where we house our business and sensor manufacturing operations; and we operate drone manufacturing operations in Lausanne, Switzerland in support of our international business activities.
  We intend to grow our business and preserve our leadership position by developing new drones, sensors and software and capturing a significant share of the global drone market. In addition, we expect to accelerate our growth and expansion through strategic acquisitions of companies offering distinct technological and competitive advantages and have defensible IP protection in place, if applicable.

AgEagle’s company culture encourages innovation and entrepreneurialism, which helps attract and retain highly skilled professionals. We believe this culture is key to nurture the design and development of the innovative, highly technical system solutions that give us our competitive advantage.
        ● Effectively manage our growth portfolio for long-term value creation. Our production and development programs present numerous investment opportunities that we believe will deliver long-term growth by providing our customers with valuable new capabilities. We evaluate each opportunity independently, as well as within the context of other investment opportunities, to determine its relative cost, timing and potential for generation of returns, and thereby its priority. This process helps us make informed decisions regarding potential growth capital requirements and supports our allocation of resources based on relative risks and returns to maximize long-term value creation, which is the key objective of our growth strategy. We also review our portfolio on a regular basis to determine if and when to narrow our focus on the highest potential growth opportunities.
        ● Growth through acquisition. Through successful execution of our growth-through-acquisition strategies, we intend to acquire technologically advanced UAS companies and intellectual property that complement and strengthen our value proposition to the market. We believe that by investing in complementary acquisitions, we can accelerate our revenue growth and deliver a broader array of innovative autonomous flight systems and solutions that address specialized market needs within our current target markets and in emerging markets that can benefit from innovations in artificial intelligence-enabled robotics and data capture and analytics.

        In December 2022, we unveiled our new eBee™ VISION, a small, fixed-wing UAS designed to provide real-time, enhanced situational awareness for critical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions; to produce and deliver eBee™ VISION fixed-wing drones and customized command and control software that proves compatible and is in full compliance with the DoD Robotic and Autonomous System-Air Interoperability Profile (“RAS-A IOP”). In addition, three branches of European military forces have taken delivery of eBee VISION drones in 2023. In support of its sales and pre-order efforts, AgEagle’s team has been engaged in numerous live demonstrations and intensive training sessions with officials from government and military agencies across the world seeking to leverage the power of eBee VISION in their respective drone operations. In July 2023 alone, we completed a comprehensive training session with our first European military customers, who were confirmed as eBee VISION operators and qualified trainers of new users. These new customers confirmed with AgEagle’s technical teams that all operational capabilities of the eBee VISION continue to meet and exceed performance benchmarks in scouting, surveillance, usability, fast deployment and flight time, among other use case criteria specified by the international military community. We have also been working in close collaboration with our network of valued added reselling partners in France, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy and Spain, among other countries, to conduct live demonstrations and technical exchanges with prospective new customers, with emphasis on showcasing use of eBee VISION UAS for public safety and first responder missions, border patrol and a wide range of commercial applications. On September 6, 2023, the Company announced that commercial production of the eBee VISION had commenced and orders for the systems are now being accepted.
  In May 2023, we released the new RedEdge-P™ dual high resolution and RGB composite drone sensor, representing yet another AgEagle technological advancement in aerial imaging cameras, seamlessly integrating the power and performance of the RedEdge-P and the new RedEdge-P blue cameras in a single solution. The RedEdge-P dual doubles analytical capabilities with the benefit of a single camera workflow. Its coastal blue band – the first of its kind in the market – was specifically designed for vegetation analysis of water bodies; environmental monitoring; water management; habitat monitoring, protection and restoration; and vegetation species and weeds identification, including differentiating and counting plants, trees, invasive species and weeds.
  In April of this year, AgEagle released Field Check for the Measure Ground Control mobile app. Measure Ground Control is a complete Software-as-a-Service solution for drone program management that is available as a web app and mobile app for both iOS and Android devices. The software’s capabilities include mission and equipment management, flight control, data processing and analysis, secure data storage and sharing, online collaboration and reporting. Field Check’s unique feature set enables users to review and validate the quality of their drone-captured imagery on-site. Capturing target imagery right the first time in one trip to a project site allows users to eliminate time loss and costs associated with project reworks by ensuring data capture is complete and ready for processing into high-resolution outputs before leaving a site. Reflecting our software development team’s superb problem-solving capabilities, Field Check provides our clients with a competitive edge in their drone operations and across the industries they serve by avoiding project repeats and downtime due to data processing errors or poor image quality.
        ● We offer market-tested drones, sensors and software solutions that have earned the longstanding trust and fidelity of customers worldwide – Through successful execution of our acquisition integration strategy in 2021, AgEagle is now delivering a unified line of industry trusted drones, sensors and software that have been vigorously tested and consistently proven across multiple industry verticals and use cases. For instance, our line of eBee fixed wing drones have flown more than one million flights over the past decade serving customers spanning surveying and mapping; engineering and construction; military/defense; mining, quarries and aggregates; agriculture humanitarian aid and environmental monitoring, to name just a few. Featured in over 100 research publications globally, advanced sensor innovations developed and commercialized by AgEagle have served to forge new industry standards for high performance, high resolution, thermal and multispectral imaging for commercial drone applications in agriculture, plant research, land management and forestry. In addition, we have championed the development of end-to-end software solutions which power autonomous flight and deliver actionable, contextual data and analytics for numerous Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and a wide range of businesses in agriculture, energy and utilities, construction and other industry sectors.
        ● AgEagle was awarded a Multiple Award Schedule (“MAS”) Contract by the U.S. federal government’s General Services Administration (“GSA”) – In April 2023, the centralized procurement arm of the federal government, the GSA, awarded us with a five-year MAS contract. The GSA Schedule Contract is a highly coveted award in the government contracting space and is the result of a rigorous proposal process involving the demonstration of products and services in-demand by government agencies, and the negotiation of their prices, qualifications, terms and conditions. Contractors selling through the GSA Contract are carefully vetted and must have a proven track record in the industry. We believe that this will serve to advance our efforts to achieve deeper penetration of the government sector over the next five years.
  37
      ● Our eBee TAC™ UAS is available for purchase for all military branches of US – We believe that the eBee TAC is ideally positioned to become an in-demand, mission critical tool for the U.S. military, government and civil agencies and our allies worldwide; and expect that this will prove to be a major growth catalyst for us in 2023, positively impacting our financial performance in the years ahead. In addition to being available for purchase under our own GSA Schedule Contract, the eBee TAC is available for purchase by U.S. government agencies and all branches of the military on GSA Schedule Contract #47QTCA18D003G, supplied by Hexagon US Federal as a standalone solution or as part of the Aerial Reconnaissance Tactical Edge Mapping Imagery System (“ARTEMIS”).
        ● Our eBee™ X series of fixed wing UAS, including the eBee X, eBee Geo and eBee TAC, are the first and only drones on the market to comply with Category 3 of the sUAS Over People rules published by the FAA. It is another important testament of our commitment to providing best-in-class solutions to our commercial customers, and we believe it will serve as a key driver in the growth of eBee utilization in the United States. We further believe it will improve the business applications made possible by our drone platform for a wide range of commercial enterprises which stand to benefit from adoption of drones in their businesses – particularly those in industries such as insurance for assessment of storm damage, telecommunications for network coverage mapping and energy for powerline and pipeline inspections, just to name a few.
        ●
Our eBee X series of drones are the world’s first UAS in its class to receive design verification for BVLOS and OOP from European Union Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”). The EASA design verification report demonstrates that the eBee X meets the highest possible quality and ground risk safety standards and, thanks to its lightweight design, effects of ground impact are reduced. As such, drone operators conducting advanced drone operations in 27 European Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland can obtain the HIGH or MEDIUM robustness levels of the M2 mitigation without additional verification from EASA. Regulatory constraints relating to limitations of BVLOS and OOP have continued to be a gating factor to widespread adoption of commercial drone technologies across a wide range of industry sectors worldwide. Being the first company to receive this DVR from EASA for M2 mitigation is a milestone for AgEagle and our industry in the European Union and will be key to fueling growth of our international customer base.
  In August 2022, we announced that the eBee X, eBee GEO and eBee AG were the first commercial drones to be designated with the C2 class identification label in accordance with EASA regulations. As of August 22, 2022, drone operators flying C2 labeled eBees are able to conduct missions in the “Open Category” with all the advantages that this entails. The C2 certification allows the eBee X series, with correct labelling, to fly at a horizontal distance of 30 meters from uninvolved people. By contrast, heavy drones like VTOLs or quadcopters must maintain a distance of 150 meters from people and any residential, commercial, industrial and recreational areas, limiting their operational capabilities to remote zones.
  In early October 2023, the eBee X series of drones were designated with the C6 class identification label in accordance with European Union regulations. As of January 1, 2024, drone operators of C6-labeled eBees will be able to conduct Beyond Visual Line of Sight (“BVLOS”) operations with airspace observers over a controlled ground area in a sparsely populated environment throughout Europe. Operators simply need to submit a required declaration with their applicable National Aviation Authority indicating whether they intend to fly missions in accordance with the European Standard Scenario- (“STS-”) 01 or STS-02. The inclusion of the C6 marking alongside our C2-labeled eBee drones will significantly enhance the market advantages for our European customers. It grants access to areas and operational modes restricted to drones weighing over 4 kg, all without the requirement for formal permissions or regulatory waivers. Currently, only eBee drones possess both the C2 and C6 marking, affirming their status as the safest choice for flying over people and conducting BVLOS operations.
        ● Our global reseller network currently has more than 200 drone solutions providers in 75+ countries – By leveraging our relationships with the specialty retailers that comprise our global reseller network, AgEagle benefits from enhanced brand-building, lower customer acquisition costs and increased reach, revenues and geographic and vertical market penetration. With the integration of our 2021 Acquisitions, we can now leverage our collective reseller network to accelerate our revenue growth by educating and encouraging our partners to market AgEagle’s full suite of airframes, sensors and software as bundled solutions in lieu of marketing only previously siloed products or product lines to end users.
          In late 2022, we partnered with government contractor Darley to expand the market reach of AgEagle’s high performance fixed wing drones and sensors to the U.S. first responder and tactical defense markets. Distinguished as one of the nation’s longest standing government contracting organizations, Darley is expected to become a key contributor to AgEagle’s success in delivering best-in-class UAS solutions to a wide range of state and federal agencies. Providing our best-in-class autonomous flight solutions for public safety applications through trusted resellers like Darley represents an entirely new market opportunity for AgEagle and one we intend to vigorously pursue in the current year.

    Impact of the Risks and Uncertainties on Our Business Operations
  Global economic challenges, including the impact of the war, pandemics, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, regulatory investigations adverse labor and capital market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The aforementioned risks and their respective impacts on the UAV industry and our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of our control. Specifically, because of the aforementioned continuing risks, the our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either we or any of our third parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products.

    Liquidity and Capital Resources
  As of September 30, 2023, we had a working capital of $2,818,220.

While we have historically been successful in raising capital to meet its working capital needs, the ability to continue raising such capital to enable us to continue our growth is not guaranteed. We will require additional liquidity to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations over the next twelve (12) months, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are evaluating strategies to obtain the required additional funding for future operations and the restructuring of operations to grow revenues and reduce expenses.

Specifically, our ability to access components, parts and labor needed to manufacture our proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and assemble products. We expect inflation and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on our business.
