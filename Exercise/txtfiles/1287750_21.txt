(2)These assets are pledged as collateral under the Company’s or the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries’ various revolving credit facilities and, as a result, are not directly available to the creditors of the Company to satisfy any obligations of the Company other than the obligations under each of the respective facilities (see Note 5).

The SDLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of the Company and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required); therefore, although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the SDLP, the Company does not believe that it has control over the SDLP (for purposes of the Investment Company Act or otherwise) because, among other things, these “voting securities” do not afford the Company the right to elect directors of the SDLP or any other special rights (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).

(6)    This portfolio company is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company's total assets. Pursuant to Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, 25% of the Company's total assets are represented by investments at fair value and other assets that are considered "non-qualifying assets" as of March 31, 2023.

(7)Variable rate loans to the Company’s portfolio companies bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), or an alternate base rate (commonly based on the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate), at the borrower’s option, which reset annually (A), semi-annually (S), quarterly (Q), bi-monthly (B), monthly (M) or daily (D). For each such loan, the Company has provided the interest rate in effect on the date presented. SOFR based contracts may include a credit spread adjustment that is charged in addition to the base rate and the stated spread.

(8)In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this security, the Company is entitled to receive an additional interest amount of 2.00% on $40.9 in aggregate principal amount of a “first out” tranche of the portfolio company’s senior term debt previously syndicated by the Company into “first out” and “last out” tranches, whereby the “first out” tranche will have priority as to the “last out” tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder.

(9)The Company sold a participating interest of approximately $80.4 in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the portfolio company’s first lien senior secured revolving loan. As the transaction did not qualify as a “true sale” in accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded a corresponding $80.4 secured borrowing, at fair value, included in “secured borrowings” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of March 31, 2023, the interest rate in effect for the secured borrowing was 12.16%.

(10)Loan was on non-accrual status as of March 31, 2023.

(11)Loan includes interest rate floor feature.

(12)In addition to the interest earned based on the stated contractual interest rate of this security, the certificates entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the SDLP’s loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the Company greater than the contractual stated interest rate.

(13)As of March 31, 2023, no amounts were funded by the Company under this first lien senior secured revolving loan; however, there were letters of credit issued and outstanding through a financial intermediary under the loan. See Note 7 for further information on letters of credit commitments related to certain portfolio companies.

(14)As of March 31, 2023, in addition to the amounts funded by the Company under this first lien senior secured revolving loan, there were also letters of credit issued and outstanding through a financial intermediary under the loan. See Note 7 for further information on letters of credit commitments related to certain portfolio companies.

(15)As of March 31, 2023, the Company had the following commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans, including commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. Such commitments are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the documents governing these loans and letters of credit and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied. See Note 7 for further information on revolving and delayed draw loan commitments, including commitments to issue letters of credit, related to certain portfolio companies.

(1)Other than the Company’s investments listed in footnote 5 below (subject to the limitations set forth therein), the Company does not “Control” any of its portfolio companies, for the purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Investment Company Act”). In general, under the Investment Company Act, the Company would “Control” a portfolio company if the Company owned more than 25% of its outstanding voting securities (i.e., securities with the right to elect directors) and/or had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. All of the Company’s portfolio company investments, which as of December 31, 2022 represented 228% of the Company’s net assets or 97% of the Company’s total assets, are subject to legal restrictions on sales.

(2)These assets are pledged as collateral under the Company’s or the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries’ various revolving credit facilities and, as a result, are not directly available to the creditors of the Company to satisfy any obligations of the Company other than the obligations under each of the respective facilities (see Note 5).

(3)Investments without an interest rate are non-income producing.

(4)As defined in the Investment Company Act, the Company is deemed to be an “Affiliated Person” because it owns 5% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities or it has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company (including through a management agreement).

*    Together with Varagon Capital Partners (“Varagon”) and its clients, the Company has co-invested through the Senior Direct Lending Program LLC (d/b/a the “Senior Direct Lending Program” or the “SDLP”). The SDLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of the Company and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required); therefore, although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the SDLP, the Company does not believe that it has control over the SDLP (for purposes of the Investment Company Act or otherwise) because, among other things, these “voting securities” do not afford the Company the right to elect directors of the SDLP or any other special rights (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).

111

(6)This portfolio company is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company's total assets. Pursuant to Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, 25% of the Company's total assets are represented by investments at fair value and other assets that are considered "non-qualifying assets" as of December 31, 2022.

(7)Variable rate loans to the Company’s portfolio companies bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), or an alternate base rate (commonly based on the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate), at the borrower’s option, which reset annually (A), semi-annually (S), quarterly (Q), bi-monthly (B), monthly (M) or daily (D). For each such loan, the Company has provided the interest rate in effect on the date presented. SOFR based contracts may include a credit spread adjustment that is charged in addition to the base rate and the stated spread.

(8)In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this security, the Company is entitled to receive an additional interest amount of 2.00% on $40.9 in aggregate principal amount of a “first out” tranche of the portfolio company’s senior term debt previously syndicated by the Company into “first out” and “last out” tranches, whereby the “first out” tranche will have priority as to the “last out” tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder.

(9)The Company sold a participating interest of approximately $79.0 in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the portfolio company’s first lien senior secured revolving loan. As the transaction did not qualify as a “true sale” in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company recorded a corresponding $79.0 secured borrowing, at fair value, included in “secured borrowings” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate in effect for the secured borrowing was 11.62%.

(10)Loan was on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2022.

(11)Loan includes interest rate floor feature.

(12)In addition to the interest earned based on the stated contractual interest rate of this security, the certificates entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the SDLP’s loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the Company greater than the contractual stated interest rate.

(13)As of December 31, 2022, no amounts were funded by the Company under this first lien senior secured revolving loan; however, there were letters of credit issued and outstanding through a financial intermediary under the loan. See Note 7 for further information on letters of credit commitments related to certain portfolio companies.

(14)As of December 31, 2022, in addition to the amounts funded by the Company under this first lien senior secured revolving loan, there were also letters of credit issued and outstanding through a financial intermediary under the loan. See Note 7 for further information on letters of credit commitments related to certain portfolio companies.

(15)As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the following commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans, including commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. Such commitments are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the documents governing these loans and letters of credit and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied. See Note 7 for further information on revolving and delayed draw loan commitments, including commitments to issue letters of credit, related to certain portfolio companies.

1. ORGANIZATION

Ares Capital Corporation (the “Company”) is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated in Maryland. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Investment Company Act”). The Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs.
 The Company’s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company invests primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position) and second lien senior secured loans. In addition to senior secured loans, the Company also invests in subordinated loans (sometimes referred to as mezzanine debt), which in some cases includes an equity component, and preferred equity. To a lesser extent, the Company also makes common equity investments.
 The Company is externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC (“Ares Capital Management” or the Company’s “investment adviser”), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (“Ares Management”), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC (“Ares Operations” or the Company’s “administrator”), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for the Company to operate.
 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company is an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations and financial condition as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period presented, have been included. The current period’s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.

The Company reclassified certain industry groupings of its portfolio companies presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 to align with the recently updated Global Industry Classification Standards (“GICS”), where applicable. These reclassifications had no impact on the prior period’s consolidated balance sheet.
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
 Cash and cash equivalents include funds from time to time deposited with financial institutions and short-term, liquid investments in a money market account. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was $23 and $12, respectively, of cash denominated in foreign currencies included within “cash and cash equivalents” or “restricted cash” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

121

Restricted cash primarily relates to cash received by the Company on behalf of participating lenders as a result of the Company’s role as administrative agent for certain loans. The cash received is generally distributed to participating lenders shortly after the receipt of such cash.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet to the total amount shown at the end of the applicable period in the consolidated statement of cash flows:

  As of
  March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022
Cash and cash equivalents $ 359  $ 303 
Restricted cash 18  34 
Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows $ 377  $ 337 
 Concentration of Credit Risk
 The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in depository or money market accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits.
 Investments
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.

Effective October 1, 2022, pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Company’s board of directors selected the Company’s investment adviser as the Company’s valuation designee to perform the fair value determinations for investments held by the Company without readily available market quotations.
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, the Company’s investment adviser, as the valuation designee, looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (i.e., substantially all of the Company’s investments) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company’s investment adviser, as the valuation designee, subject to the oversight of the Company’s board of directors, based on, among other things, the input of the Company’s independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged to support the valuation of such portfolio investments at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter by the Company’s investment adviser, and a portion of the Company’s investment portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, the Company’s valuation process within the context of performing the Company’s integrated audit.
 As part of the valuation process, the Company’s investment adviser may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of the Company’s investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company’s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets, which may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, the Company’s investment adviser considers the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the valuation.
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in the Company’s portfolio, substantially all of the Company’s portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by its investment
122

adviser, as the valuation designee, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company’s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company’s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it.
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

The Company’s investment adviser, as the valuation designee, subject to the oversight of the Company’s board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

•The Company’s quarterly valuation process begins with a preliminary valuation being prepared by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the Company’s portfolio management and valuation team.

•Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed by the valuation committee of the Company’s investment adviser.

•The valuation committee of the Company’s investment adviser determines the fair value of each investment in the Company’s portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firms, where applicable.
 See Note 8 for more information on the Company’s valuation process.

Interest Income Recognition
 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts, amortization of premiums and payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest. Discounts from and premiums to par value on investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method. To the extent loans contain PIK provisions, PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable agreement, is accrued and recorded as interest income and added to the principal balance of the loan. PIK interest income added to the principal balance is generally collected upon repayment of the outstanding principal. To maintain the Company’s tax status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends for the year the income was earned, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for any accretion of discounts, amortization of premiums and PIK interest.

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company’s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid or there is no longer any reasonable doubt that such principal or interest will be collected in full and, in the Company’s judgment, are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value (i.e., typically measured as enterprise value of the portfolio company) or is in the process of collection.

Dividend Income Recognition 

Dividend income on preferred equity is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. To the extent a preferred equity contains PIK provisions, PIK dividends, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable agreement, are accrued and recorded as dividend income and added to the principal balance of the preferred equity. PIK dividends added to the principal balance are generally collected upon redemption of the equity.
 123

Capital Structuring Service Fees and Other Income
 In pursuit of the Company’s investment objective, the Company’s investment adviser seeks to provide assistance to its portfolio companies and in return the Company may receive fees for capital structuring services. These fees are fixed based on contractual terms, are generally only available to the Company as a result of the Company’s underlying investments, are normally paid at the closing of the investments, are generally non-recurring and non-refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned upon closing of the investment. The services that the Company’s investment adviser provides vary by investment, but generally include reviewing existing credit facilities, arranging bank financing, arranging equity financing, structuring financing from multiple lenders, structuring financing from multiple equity investors, restructuring existing loans, raising equity and debt capital, and providing general financial advice, which concludes upon closing of the investment. Any services of the above nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee payable to the Company. In certain instances where the Company is invited to participate as a co-lender in a transaction and does not provide significant services in connection with the investment, a portion of loan fees paid to the Company in such situations will be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan.

Other income includes amendment fees that are fixed based on contractual terms and are generally non-recurring and
non-refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned upon closing of the related transaction. Other income also includes fees for management and consulting services, agency services, loan guarantees, commitments, and other services rendered by the Company to portfolio companies. Such fees are fixed based on contractual terms and are recognized as income as services are rendered.
 Foreign Currency Translation
 The Company’s books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:
 (1)Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities—at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the period.

(2)Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses—at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions, income or expenses.
 Results of operations based on changes in foreign exchange rates are separately disclosed in the statement of operations, if any. Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities. 

Derivative Instruments
 The Company does not utilize hedge accounting and as such values its derivatives at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses recorded in “net unrealized gains (losses) from foreign currency and other transactions” in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
 Equity Offering Expenses
 The Company’s offering costs are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when proceeds are received.
 Debt Issuance Costs
 Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt instrument using the straight line method or the effective yield method, depending on the type of debt instrument.

Secured Borrowings

The Company follows the guidance in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (“ASC Topic 860”), when accounting for participations and other partial loan sales. Certain loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860 because these sales do not meet the definition of a “participating interest,” as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment
124

to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest or which are not eligible for sale accounting remain as an investment on the consolidated balance sheet as required under GAAP and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value.
  Leases

The Company is obligated under a number of operating leases pursuant to which it is leasing office facilities from third parties with remaining terms ranging from approximately one to four years. Such operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have any finance leases.

The ROU asset represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the operating lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from such lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit discount rate, and as such the Company uses its weighted average borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the remaining lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. The Company has elected as a practical expedient to treat non-lease components as part of the lease as these components are not significant when compared to the lease component.

Income Taxes
 The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of- income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes.
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.
 The Company may hold certain portfolio company investments through consolidated taxable subsidiaries. Such subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. These consolidated subsidiaries recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and the reported amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet using the applicable statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which any such temporary differences are expected to reverse.    
 Dividends to Common Stockholders
 Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Company’s board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management and considers the level of undistributed taxable income carried forward from the prior year for distribution in the current year. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.
 The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company’s board of directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend, then the Company’s stockholders who have not “opted out” of the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividend. The Company may use newly issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan or, if the Company is otherwise permitted under applicable law to purchase such shares, the Company may purchase shares in the open market in connection with the Company’s obligations under the dividend reinvestment plan.
 Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
 125

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of actual and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income or loss and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the valuation of investments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standard updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). ASUs not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or expected to have minimal impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (“ASU 2020-04”),” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (“ASU 2020-01”), which expanded the scope of ASU 2020-04 to include derivative instruments impacted by discounting transition. ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 are effective for all entities through December 31, 2022. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging transactions as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which deferred the sunset of this guidance to December 31, 2024. The Company has concluded that this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

3. AGREEMENTS

Investment Advisory and Management Agreement
 The Company is party to an investment advisory and management agreement (the “investment advisory and management agreement”), with its investment adviser, Ares Capital Management. Subject to the overall supervision of the Company’s board of directors and in accordance with the Investment Company Act, Ares Capital Management provides investment advisory and management services to the Company. For providing these services, Ares Capital Management receives fees from the Company consisting of a base management fee, a fee based on the Company’s net investment income (“income based fee”) and a fee based on the Company’s net capital gains (“capital gains incentive fee”). The investment advisory and management agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party.
 Effective June 21, 2019, in connection with the Company’s board of directors’ approval of the modification of the asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities from 200% to 150%, the investment advisory and management agreement was amended to reduce the Company’s annual base management fee rate from 1.5% to 1.0% on all assets financed using leverage over 1.0x debt to equity. For all assets financed using leverage up to 1.0x debt to equity, the annual base management fee rate remains at 1.5%. The base management fee is based on the average value of the Company’s total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and is calculated by applying the applicable fee rate. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. See Note 5 for additional information.
 The income based fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the income based fee and capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred income feature (such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Company’s investment adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the income based fees it received that was based on accrued income that the Company never actually received.
126

 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation, unrealized capital depreciation or income tax expense related to realized gains and losses. Because of the structure of the income based fee, it is possible that the Company may pay such fees in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company earns pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable income based fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses.
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company’s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter. If market credit spreads rise, the Company may be able to invest its funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which may increase the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Company’s investment adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an income based fee based on such net investment income. To the extent the Company has retained pre-incentive fee net investment income that has been used to calculate the income based fee, it is also included in the amount of the Company’s total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) used to calculate the base management fee.

The Company pays its investment adviser an income based fee with respect to the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
 •No income based fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate;

•100% of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. The Company refers to this portion of its pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%) as the “catch-up” provision. The “catch-up” is meant to provide the Company’s investment adviser with 20% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeded 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and

•20% of the amount of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter.
 These calculations are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter.

The capital gains incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or, upon termination of the investment advisory and management agreement, as of the termination date) and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (a) the sum of the Company’s cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (b) the Company’s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from October 8, 2004 (the date the Company completed its initial public offering). Realized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investments and foreign currencies, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and from other assets, as well as any income tax and other expenses related to cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses. If such amount is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no capital gains incentive fee for such year.
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company’s portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company’s portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
 The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company’s portfolio as of the applicable capital gains incentive fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is required by GAAP to record an investment at its fair value as of the time of acquisition instead of at the actual amount paid for such investment by the Company (including, for example, as a result of the application of the asset acquisition method of accounting), then solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, the “accreted or amortized cost basis” of an investment shall be an amount (the “Contractual Cost Basis”) equal to (1) (x) the actual amount paid by the Company for such investment plus (y) any amounts recorded in the Company’s financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the accretion of such investment plus (z) any other adjustments made to the cost basis included in the Company’s financial statements, including PIK interest or additional amounts funded (net of repayments) minus (2) any amounts recorded in the Company’s financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the amortization of such investment, whether such calculated Contractual Cost Basis is higher or lower than the fair value of such investment (as determined in accordance with GAAP) at the time of acquisition.
  The base management fees, income based fees and capital gains incentive fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

For the Three Months Ended March 31,
2023 2022
Base management fees $ 79  $ 73 
Income based fees $ 76  $ 51 
Capital gains incentive fees(1) $ (6) $ 2 
________________________________________

(1)Calculated in accordance with GAAP as discussed below.

There was no capital gains incentive fee payable to the Company’s investment adviser as calculated under the investment advisory and management agreement for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. In addition, in accordance with GAAP, the Company had cumulatively accrued a capital gains incentive fee of $29 as of March 31, 2023. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment advisory and management agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. As of March 31, 2023, the Company has paid capital gains incentive fees since inception totaling $133. The resulting accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future.

Cash payment of any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees otherwise earned by the Company’s investment adviser is deferred if during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to the Company’s stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 7.0% of the Company’s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees deferred for payment are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such fees are payable under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement. Pursuant to the terms under the investment advisory and management agreement, as of March 31, 2023, payment of $81 of the income based fees earned by the Company’s investment adviser for the fourth quarter of 2022 had been previously deferred. As of March 31, 2023, such deferred income based fees were payable under the terms of the investment advisory management agreement.
 The services of all investment professionals and staff of the Company’s investment adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to the Company, and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Company’s investment adviser. Under the investment
128

advisory and management agreement, the Company bears all other costs and expenses of its operations and transactions, including, but not limited to, those relating to: organization; calculation of the Company’s net asset value (including, but not limited to, the cost and expenses of any independent third-party valuation firm); expenses incurred by the Company’s investment adviser payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers, in monitoring the Company’s financial and legal affairs and in monitoring the Company’s investments (including the cost of consultants hired to develop information technology systems designed to monitor the Company’s investments) and performing due diligence on the Company’s prospective portfolio companies; interest payable on indebtedness, if any, incurred to finance the Company’s investments (including payments to third party vendors for financial information services); offerings of the Company’s common stock and other securities; investment advisory and management fees; administration fees; fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, regardless of whether such transactions are ultimately consummated; transfer agent and custodial fees; registration fees; listing fees; taxes; independent directors’ fees and expenses; costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC; the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; to the extent the Company is covered by any joint insurance policies, the Company’s allocable portion of the insurance premiums for such policies; direct costs and expenses of administration, including auditor and legal costs; and all other expenses incurred by the Company or its administrator in connection with administering the Company’s business as described in more detail under “Administration Agreement” below.

Administration Agreement
 The Company is party to an administration agreement (the “administration agreement”) with its administrator, Ares Operations. Pursuant to the administration agreement, Ares Operations furnishes the Company with office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at the Company’s office facilities. Under the administration agreement, Ares Operations also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Company’s required administrative services, which include, among other things, providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to its stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, Ares Operations assists the Company in determining and publishing its net asset value, assists the Company in providing managerial assistance to its portfolio companies, oversees the preparation and filing of the Company’s tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to its stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of its expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon its allocable portion of Ares Operations’ overhead and other expenses (including travel expenses) incurred by Ares Operations in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including the Company’s allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of certain of its officers (including the Company’s chief compliance officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, general counsel, secretary, treasurer and assistant treasurer) and their respective staffs. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party.
 For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $3 and $4, respectively, in administrative fees. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $3 and $2, respectively, in administrative fees were unpaid and included in “accounts payable and other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Senior Direct Lending Program

The Company has established a joint venture with Varagon to make certain first lien senior secured loans, including certain stretch senior and unitranche loans, primarily to U.S. middle-market companies. Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. and other partners. The joint venture is called the SDLP. In July 2016, the Company and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $450. The Company and other accounts managed by the Company’s investment adviser and its affiliates may directly co-invest with the SDLP to accommodate larger transactions. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of the Company and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).

The Company provides capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the “SDLP Certificates”), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and a client of Varagon owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates.

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and Varagon and its clients had agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of $6,150 and $6,150, respectively, in the aggregate, of which $1,444 and $1,444, respectively, is to be made available from the Company. The Company will continue to provide capital to the SDLP in the form of SDLP Certificates, and Varagon and its clients will provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP as discussed above. Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SDLP.

Pursuant to the IHAM administration agreement, Ares Operations provides IHAM with, among other things, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, services relating to the marketing and sale of interests in vehicles managed by IHAM, services of, and oversight of, custodians, depositories, accountants, attorneys, underwriters and such other persons in any other capacity deemed to be necessary. Under the IHAM administration agreement, IHAM reimburses Ares Operations for all of the actual costs associated with such services, including Ares Operations’ allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of its officers, employees and respective staff in performing its obligations under the IHAM administration agreement.

Selected Financial Information

Pursuant to Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, selected financial information of IHAM, in conformity with GAAP, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented below.

In conformity with GAAP, IHAM is required to consolidate entities in which IHAM has a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model, which include certain of the IHAM Vehicles (the “Consolidated IHAM Vehicles”). As such, for GAAP purposes only, IHAM consolidates (a) entities in which it holds a majority voting interest or has majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity and (b) entities that it concludes are variable interest entities in which IHAM has more than insignificant economic interest and power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities, and for which IHAM is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.

When IHAM consolidates an IHAM Vehicle for GAAP purposes only, IHAM reflects the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles on a gross basis, including the economic interests held by third-party investors in the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles as debt obligations, subordinated notes or non-controlling interests, in the consolidated IHAM financials below. All of the revenues earned by IHAM as the investment manager of the IHAM Consolidated Vehicles are eliminated in GAAP consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by third-party investors, the GAAP consolidation of an IHAM Vehicle does not impact the net income or loss
134

attributable to IHAM. As a result, the Company believes an assessment of IHAM's business and the impact to the Company’s investment in IHAM is best viewed on a stand-alone basis as reflected in the first column in the tables below.

Revolving Credit Facility
 The Company is party to a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended and restated, the “Revolving Credit Facility”), that allows the Company to borrow up to $4,843 at any one time outstanding. The Revolving Credit Facility consists of a $1,087 term loan tranche and a $3,756 revolving tranche. For $1,009 of the term loan tranche, the stated maturity date is March 31, 2027. For $28 of the term loan tranche, the stated maturity date is March 31, 2026. For the remaining $50 of the term loan tranche, the stated maturity date is March 30, 2025. For $3,499 of the revolving tranche, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2027, respectively. For $107 of the revolving tranche, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2026, respectively. For the remaining $150 of the revolving tranche, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are March 30, 2024 and March 30, 2025, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a feature that allows the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall size of the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum of $7,265. The Revolving Credit Facility generally requires payments of interest at the end of each Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly, on SOFR based loans, and monthly payments of interest on other loans. Subsequent to the end of the respective revolving periods and prior to the respective stated maturity dates, the Company is required to repay the relevant outstanding principal amounts under both the term loan tranche and revolving tranche on a monthly basis in an amount equal to 1/12th of the outstanding principal amount at the end of the respective revolving periods. See Note 14 for a subsequent event relating to the Revolving Credit Facility.

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar revolving credit facilities, including, without limitation, covenants related to: (a) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, (b) limitations on certain investments, (c) limitations on certain restricted payments, (d) maintaining a certain minimum stockholders’ equity, (e) maintaining a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities not representing indebtedness) to total indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) of not less than 1.5:1.0, (f) limitations on pledging certain unencumbered assets, and (g) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on certain properties of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the documents governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are also subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets (based on their value as determined pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility) that are pledged as collateral. As of March 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility.
 As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was $1,872 and $2,246 outstanding, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit for up to an aggregate amount of $297.5 with the ability to increase by an incremental $102.5 on an uncommitted basis. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $93 and $86, respectively, in letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued. As of March 31, 2023, there was $2,878 available for borrowing (net of letters of credit issued) under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base restrictions.
 Since March 31, 2022, the interest rate charged on the Revolving Credit Facility is based on SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% (or an alternate rate of interest for certain loans, commitments and/or other extensions of credit denominated in Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Euros and certain other foreign currencies plus a spread adjustment, if applicable) and an applicable spread of either 1.75% or 1.875% or an “alternate base rate” (as defined in the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility) plus an applicable spread of 0.75% or 0.875%, in each case, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) the aggregate amount of revolving exposure and term loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and (b) 85% of the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility (or, if higher, the total revolving exposure) plus (ii) other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for borrowings to be made using one, three or six month SOFR. Prior to March 31, 2022, the interest rate charged on the Revolving Credit Facility was based on LIBOR (or an alternate rate of interest for certain loans, commitments and/or other extensions of credit denominated in Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Euros and certain other foreign currencies) plus an applicable spread of either 1.75% or 1.875% or an “alternate base rate” (as defined in the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility) plus an applicable spread of 0.75% or 0.875%, in each case, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) the aggregate amount of revolving exposure and term loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and (b) 85% of the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility (or, if higher, the total revolving exposure) plus (ii) other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2023, the one, three and six month SOFR was 4.81%, 4.91% and 4.90%, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, the applicable spread in effect was 1.75%. In addition to the stated interest expense on the
140

Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum on any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company is also required to pay a letter of credit fee of either 2.00% or 2.125% per annum on letters of credit issued, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by certain assets in the Company’s portfolio and excludes investments held by Ares Capital CP under the Revolving Funding Facility, those held by ACJB under the SMBC Funding Facility and those held by AFB under the BNP Funding Facility, each as described below, and certain other investments.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the components of interest and credit facility fees expense, cash paid for interest expense, average stated interest rates (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) and average outstanding balances for the Revolving Credit Facility were as follows:

The Company and Ares Capital CP are also required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Investment Commitments

The Company has various commitments to fund investments in its portfolio as described below. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had the following commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans, including commitments to fund which are at (or substantially at) the Company’s discretion:
  As of
  March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022
Total revolving and delayed draw loan commitments $ 2,559  $ 2,916 
Less: funded commitments (609) (526)
Total unfunded commitments 1,950  2,390 
Less: commitments substantially at discretion of the Company —  — 
Less: unavailable commitments due to borrowing base or other covenant restrictions (16) (13)
Total net adjusted unfunded revolving and delayed draw loan commitments $ 1,934  $ 2,377 
    Included within the total revolving and delayed draw loan commitments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were delayed draw loan commitments totaling $908 and $1,229, respectively. The Company’s commitment to fund delayed draw loans is generally triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels).

Also included within the total revolving loan commitments as of March 31, 2023 were commitments to issue up to $351 in letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $49 in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For all these letters of credit issued and outstanding, the Company would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $42 expire in 2023 and $7 expire in 2024.
 The Company also has commitments to co-invest in the SDLP for the Company’s portion of the SDLP’s commitments to fund delayed draw loans to certain portfolio companies of the SDLP. See Note 4 for more information.

Total equity commitments $ 168  $ 120 
Less: funded equity commitments (63) (69)
Total unfunded equity commitments 105  51 
Less: equity commitments substantially at discretion of the Company (51) (51)
Total net adjusted unfunded equity commitments $ 54  $ — 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company may sell certain of its investments to third party purchasers. In particular, in connection with the sale of certain controlled portfolio company equity investments (as well as certain other sales) the Company has, and may continue to do so in the future, agreed to indemnify such purchasers for future liabilities arising from the investments and the related sale transaction. Such indemnification provisions have given rise to liabilities in the past and may do so in the future.

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may guarantee certain obligations in connection with its portfolio companies (in particular, certain controlled portfolio companies). Under these guarantee arrangements, payments may be required to be made to third parties if such guarantees are called upon or if the portfolio companies were to default on their related obligations, as applicable.

Lease Commitments

The Company is obligated under a number of operating leases pursuant to which it is leasing office facilities from third parties with remaining terms ranging from approximately one to four years.

8. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company follows ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASC 825-10”), which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and a better understanding of the effect of the company’s choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. The Company has not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled “other assets” and “debt,” which are reported at amortized cost, the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximate fair value.
 The Company also follows ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820-10”), which expands the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Company to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company has considered its principal market as the market in which the Company exits its portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820-10, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:
149


•Level 1—Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.

•Level 2—Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.

•Level 3—Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
 In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company continues to employ the net asset valuation policy approved by the Company’s board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820-10 (see Note 2 for more information). Consistent with the Company’s valuation policy, the Company’s investment adviser evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which the Company’s investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. The Company’s valuation policy considers the fact that because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in the Company’s portfolio, the fair value of the investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs.
     The Company’s portfolio investments (other than as described below in the following paragraph) are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value (“EV”) of the portfolio company. Enterprise value means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company’s EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. The Company’s investment adviser may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where the Company has control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where the Company does not own a controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, the Company’s investment adviser considers the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by the Company are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Company’s investment adviser depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.
 For other portfolio investments such as investments in the SDLP Certificates and IHAM, discounted cash flow analysis is the primary technique utilized to determine fair value. Expected future cash flows associated with the investment are discounted to determine a present value using a discount rate that reflects estimated market return requirements.

 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company’s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company’s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it.

In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

The Equity Distribution Agreements provide that the Company may from time to time issue and sell, by means of “at the market” offerings, up to $500 shares of its common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreements, sales of common stock, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under the Equity Distribution Agreements, common stock with an aggregate offering amount of $137 remained available for issuance as of March 31, 2023.

The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, based upon an evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock or any shares of common stock at all. Consequently, the Company cannot assure stockholders that any specific number of shares of common stock, if any, will be repurchased under the stock repurchase program. As of March 31, 2023, the expiration date of the stock repurchase program is February 15, 2024. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. As of March 31, 2023, there was $500 available for repurchases under the stock repurchase program. See Note 14 for a subsequent event relating to the Company’s stock repurchase program.

During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares of the Company’s common stock under the stock repurchase program.

OVERVIEW

We are a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Investment Company Act”).
 We are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC (“Ares Capital Management” or our “investment adviser”), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) (“Ares Management”), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC (“Ares Operations” or our “administrator”), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position) and second lien senior secured loans. In addition to senior secured loans, we also invest in subordinated loans (sometimes referred to as mezzanine debt), which in some cases includes an equity component and preferred equity.
 To a lesser extent, we also make common equity investments, which have generally been non-control equity investments of less than $20 million (usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment). However, we may increase the size or change the nature of these investments.
 Since our initial public offering (“IPO”) on October 8, 2004 through March 31, 2023, our exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 14% (based on original cash invested, net of syndications, of approximately $40.1 billion and total proceeds from such exited investments of approximately $51.6 billion). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 58% of these exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.

Additionally, since our IPO on October 8, 2004 through March 31, 2023, our realized gains have exceeded our realized losses by approximately $1.1 billion (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital Corporation (“Allied Capital”) in April 2010 (the “Allied Acquisition”) and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other
161

transactions). For this same time period, our average annualized net realized gain rate was approximately 1.0% (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other transactions). Net realized gain/loss rates for a particular period are the amount of net realized gains/losses during such period divided by the average quarterly investments at amortized cost in such period.
 Information included herein regarding internal rates of return, realized gains and losses and annualized net realized gain rates are historical results relating to our past performance and are not necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which cannot be assured.

As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered “eligible portfolio companies” (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.
 We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay U.S. federal corporate-level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we satisfy those requirements.

MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

Credit markets continued to be under pressure during the first quarter of 2023 amid a risk-off environment and sustained macro-economic uncertainty due to record-high inflation, tighter financial conditions, financial market instability and growing recession risk. Central banks have remained focused on restoring price stability by raising interest rates and have signaled that growth may be hindered until inflation comes under control.

(1)First lien senior secured loans include certain loans that we classify as “unitranche” loans. The total amortized cost and fair value of the loans that we classified as “unitranche” loans were $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2023, and $5.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.

(2)The proceeds from these certificates were applied to co-investments with Varagon Capital Partners (“Varagon”) and its clients to fund first lien senior secured loans to 22 and 22 different borrowers as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

(3)Includes our subordinated loan and equity investments in IHAM, as applicable.

We have commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans, including commitments to fund which are at (or substantially at) our discretion. Our commitment to fund delayed draw loans is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels). We are also party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments in private equity investment partnerships. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for more

 Ares Capital Management employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. The following is a description of each investment grade:

165

Investment grade Description
4 Involves the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit.
3 Involves a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3.
2 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. For investments graded 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.
1 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.
    Set forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Senior Direct Lending Program

We have established a joint venture with Varagon to make certain first lien senior secured loans, including certain stretch senior and unitranche loans, primarily to U.S. middle-market companies. Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. and other partners. The joint venture is called the Senior Direct Lending Program, LLC (d/b/a the “Senior Direct Lending Program” or the “SDLP”). In July 2016, we and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $450 million. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of ours and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).

We provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the “SDLP Certificates”), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. As of March 31, 2023, we and a client of Varagon owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates.

    As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we and Varagon and its clients had agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of $6.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, in the aggregate, of which $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, is
166

to be made available from us. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP. Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SDLP.

(1) At principal amount.

(2)These commitments to fund delayed draw loans have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP and will be funded if and when conditions to funding such delayed draw loans are met.

The SDLP Certificates pay a coupon equal to LIBOR plus 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes.

IHAM earns fee income from managing the IHAM Vehicles and has also invested in certain of these vehicles as part of its business strategy.

From time to time, IHAM or certain IHAM Vehicles may purchase investments from, or sell investments to us. For any such sales or purchases by the IHAM Vehicles to or from us, the IHAM Vehicle must obtain approval from third parties unaffiliated with us or IHAM, as applicable. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, IHAM or certain of the IHAM Vehicles purchased $652 million and $1,176 million, respectively, of loans from us. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $10 million and $6 million, respectively, of net realized losses from these sales. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we did not purchase investments from IHAM or the IHAM Vehicles. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we purchased $27 million of investments from certain IHAM Vehicles.

IHAM is party to an administration agreement, referred to herein as the “IHAM administration agreement,” with Ares Operations. Pursuant to the IHAM administration agreement, Ares Operations provides IHAM with, among other
171

things, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, services relating to the marketing and sale of interests in vehicles managed by IHAM, services of, and oversight of, custodians, depositories, accountants, attorneys, underwriters and such other persons in any other capacity deemed to be necessary. Under the IHAM administration agreement, IHAM reimburses Ares Operations for all of the actual costs associated with such services, including Ares Operations’ allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of its officers, employees and respective staff in performing its obligations under the IHAM administration agreement.

Selected Financial Information

Pursuant to Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, selected financial information of IHAM, in conformity with GAAP, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented below.

In conformity with GAAP, IHAM is required to consolidate entities in which IHAM has a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model, which include certain of the IHAM Vehicles (the “Consolidated IHAM Vehicles”). As such, for GAAP purposes only, IHAM consolidates (a) entities in which it holds a majority voting interest or has majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity and (b) entities that it concludes are variable interest entities in which IHAM has more than insignificant economic interest and power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities, and for which IHAM is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.

When IHAM consolidates an IHAM Vehicle for GAAP purposes only, IHAM reflects the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles on a gross basis, including the economic interests held by third-party investors in the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles as debt obligations, subordinated notes or non-controlling interests, in the consolidated IHAM financials below. All of the revenues earned by IHAM as the investment manager of the IHAM Consolidated Vehicles are eliminated in GAAP consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by third-party investors, the GAAP consolidation of an IHAM Vehicle does not impact the net income or loss attributable to IHAM. As a result, we believe an assessment of IHAM's business and the impact to our investment in IHAM is best viewed on a stand-alone basis as reflected in the first column in the tables below.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022

Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:
  For the Three Months Ended March 31,
(in millions) 2023 2022
Total investment income $ 618  $ 440 
Total expenses 298  229 
Net investment income before income taxes 320  211

Net increase in stockholders’ equity resulting from operations $ 278  $ 211 

Net income can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, comparisons of net increase in stockholders’ equity resulting from operations may not be meaningful.

Investment Income

Interest income from investments $ 470  $ 310 
Capital structuring service fees 10  30 
Dividend income 121  88 
Other income 17  12 
Total investment income $ 618  $ 440 

Interest income from investments for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from the comparable period in 2022 primarily as a result of the impact of rising interest rates as well as an increase in the average size of our portfolio. The average size and weighted average yield of our portfolio at amortized cost for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

  For the Three Months Ended March 31,
(dollar amounts in millions) 2023 2022
Average size of portfolio $ 21,736  $ 19,559 
Weighted average yield on portfolio 10.9  % 8.1  %

Capital structuring service fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to a decrease in new investment commitments and a decrease in the weighted average capital structuring service fee percentage during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Excluding investment commitments to IHAM, the higher weighted average capital structuring service fee percentage during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher fee opportunities as compared to the comparable period in 2022. The new investment commitments and weighted average capital structuring service fee percentages for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

  For the Three Months Ended March 31,
(dollar amounts in millions) 2023 2022
New investment commitments $ 766  $ 2,001 
Weighted average capital structuring service fee percentages(1) 1.3  % 1.5  %

_______________________________________________________________________________
175


(1)    Excluding $283 million and $349 million of investment commitments to IHAM for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the weighted average capital structuring service fee percentage was 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively.

Dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

  For the Three Months Ended March 31,
(in millions) 2023 2022
Dividend income received from IHAM $ 57  $ 43 
Recurring dividend income 55  39 
Non-recurring dividend income 9  6 
Total dividend income $ 121  $ 88 

Dividend income received from IHAM for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to the continued increase in IHAM’s assets under management, which generally has been supported by our additional investments in IHAM. Recurring dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in yielding preferred equity investments.
    Operating Expenses

_______________________________________________________________________________
                         (1)Calculated in accordance with GAAP as discussed below.

Interest and credit facility fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, were comprised of the following:
  For the Three Months Ended March 31,
(in millions) 2023 2022
Stated interest expense $ 128  $ 84 
Credit facility fees 5  3 
Amortization of debt issuance costs 7  7 
Net amortization of premium on notes payable (1) (1)
Total interest and credit facility fees $ 139  $ 93 

Stated interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to the increase in the average principal amount of debt outstanding and the rising interest rates on our floating rate revolving facilities. Our weighted average stated interest rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from the comparable period in 2022 due to the higher utilization of our floating rate revolving facilities and the impact of rising interest rates. Average debt outstanding and weighted average stated interest rate on our debt outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:


176

  For the Three Months Ended March 31,
(dollar amounts in millions) 2023 2022
Average debt outstanding $ 11,422  $ 10,731 
Weighted average stated interest rate on debt 4.4  % 3.2  %

Credit facility fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were higher from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to the lower utilization of our revolving facilities as a result of the commitment increases during 2023, resulting in higher unused commitment fees.

Base management fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to the increase in the average size of our portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the comparable period in 2022.

Income based fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to the pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement for the three months ended March 31, 2023 being higher than in the comparable period in 2022.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the reduction in the capital gains incentive fee calculated in accordance with GAAP was $6 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the capital gains incentive fee calculated in accordance with GAAP was $2 million. The capital gains incentive fee accrual for the three months ended March 31, 2023 changed from the comparable period in 2022 primarily due to net losses on investments, foreign currency, other transactions and the extinguishment of debt of $40 million compared to net gains of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP includes an accrual related to unrealized capital appreciation, whereas the capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement does not. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. As of March 31, 2023, there was $29 million of capital gains incentive fees accrued in accordance with GAAP. As of March 31, 2023, there was no capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023, for more information on the base management fees, income based fees and capital gains incentive fees.
 Cash payment of any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees otherwise earned by our investment adviser is deferred if during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 7.0% of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees deferred for payment are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such fees are payable under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement. Pursuant to these terms, payment of $81 million of the income based fees earned by our investment adviser for the fourth quarter of 2022 had been previously deferred. As of March 31, 2023, such deferred income based fees were payable under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023, for more information on the related deferral terms.

Administrative fees represent fees paid to Ares Operations for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Ares Operations in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of certain of our corporate officers and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023, for more information on the administrative fees.

Other general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees, insurance, fees and expenses related to evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies and independent directors’ fees.

Income Tax Expense, Including Excise Tax

We have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes.
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded an expense of $9 million and $9 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax.

Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a net tax (benefit) expense of $(7) million and $3 million, respectively, for these subsidiaries. The income tax expense for our taxable consolidated subsidiaries will vary depending on the level of realized gains from the exits of investments held by such taxable subsidiaries during the respective periods.

Net Realized Gains/Losses

The net realized gains (losses) from the sales, repayments or exits of investments during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were comprised of the following:

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of public offerings of equity and debt securities, advances from the Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Funding Facility, the SMBC Funding Facility and the BNP Funding Facility (each as defined below, and together, the “Facilities”), net proceeds from the issuance of other securities, including unsecured notes, as well as cash flows from operations.
 In accordance with the Investment Company Act, we are allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowings (i.e., we are able to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities issued by us). As of March 31, 2023, we had $359 million in cash and cash equivalents and $11.2 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding ($11.2 billion at carrying value) and our asset coverage was 189%. Subject to borrowing base and other restrictions, we had approximately $4.4 billion available for additional borrowings under the Facilities as of March 31, 2023.
 We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of common stock or outstanding debt, or incurrence or issuance of additional debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.
Equity Capital Activities

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our total equity market capitalization was $9.9 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively.
    We may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock through public or “at the market” offerings. In connection with the issuance of our common stock, we issued and sold the following shares of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2023:

(in millions, except per share amount)
Issuances of Common Stock Number of Shares Issued Gross Proceeds Underwriting Fees/Offering Expenses Net Proceeds Average Offering Price Per Share(1)
Public offerings 12.1 $ 236.8  $ 13.4  $ 223.4  $ 19.61  (2)

(2)    12.1 million of the shares were sold to the underwriters for a price of $18.53 per share which the underwriters were then permitted to sell at variable prices to the public.

“At the Market” Offerings

We are a party to equity distribution agreements with several banks (the “Equity Distribution Agreements”). The Equity Distribution Agreements provide that we may from time to time issue and sell, by means of “at the market” offerings, up to $500 million shares of our common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreements, sales of common stock, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under the currently effective Equity Distribution Agreements, common stock with an aggregate offering amount of $137 million remained available for issuance as of March 31, 2023.

Stock Repurchase Program

We are authorized under our stock repurchase program to purchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our sole discretion, based upon an evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock or any shares of common stock at all. Consequently, we cannot assure stockholders that any specific number of shares of common stock, if any, will be repurchased under the stock repurchase program. As of March 31, 2023, the expiration date of the stock repurchase program is February 15, 2024. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. As of March 31, 2023, there was $500 million available for additional repurchases under the program. See “Recent Developments,” as well as Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for a subsequent event relating to our stock repurchase program.
 
During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the open market under the stock repurchase program.

As of March 31, 2023, we were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the 2024 Convertible Notes Indenture and the indentures governing the Unsecured Notes.

The 2024 Convertible Notes and the Unsecured Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Convertible Notes and the Unsecured Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

In April 2023, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment, among other things, (a) extended the expiration of the revolving period for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $2.9 billion from March 31, 2026 to April 19, 2027, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) extended the stated maturity date for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $2.9 billion from March 31, 2027 to April 19, 2028 and (c) extended the stated maturity date for $908 million of the lenders electing to extend their term loan commitments from March 31, 2027 to April 19, 2028. Lenders who elected not to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $150 million, $107 million and $494 million will remain subject to a revolving period expiration of March 30, 2024, March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2026, respectively, and stated maturity dates of March 30, 2025, March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2027, respectively. Lenders who elected not to extend their term loan commitments in an amount equal to $50
186

million, $28 million and $116 million will remain subject to maturity dates of March 30, 2025, March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2027, respectively.

In April 2023, we and our consolidated subsidiary, AFB, entered into an amendment to the BNP Funding Facility. The amendment among other things, (a) increased the commitments under the BNP Funding Facility from $500 million to $790 million, (b) extended the end of the reinvestment period and the stated maturity date from June 11, 2023 and June 11, 2025 to April 20, 2026 and April 20, 2028, respectively and (c) adjusted the interest rate charged on the BNP Funding Facility from an applicable SOFR or a "base rate" (as defined in the BNP Funding Facility) plus a margin of (i) 2.30% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 2.80% following the reinvestment period to an applicable SOFR or a "base rate" plus a margin of (i) 2.80% during the reinvestment period and (ii) 3.30% following the reinvestment period.

In April 2023, our board of directors authorized an amendment to our stock repurchase program to increase the total authorization from $500 million to $1.0 billion. Under the stock repurchase program, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at a price per share that meets certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.

From April 1, 2023 through April 19, 2023, we made new investment commitments of approximately $369 million, of which $311 million were funded. Of these new investment commitments, 66% were in first lien senior secured loans and 34% were in second lien senior secured loans. Of the approximately $369 million of new investment commitments, 67% were floating rate and 33% were fixed rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 11.4% and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 11.3%. We may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.

From April 1, 2023 through April 19, 2023, we exited approximately $397 million of investment commitments, including $4 million of loans sold to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM. Of the total investment commitments exited, 78% were first lien senior secured loans, 21% were second lien senior secured loans and 1% were senior subordinated loans. Of the approximately $397 million of exited investment commitments, 99% were floating rate and 1% were fixed rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 10.8% and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 10.8%. Of the approximately $397 million of investment commitments exited from April 1, 2023 through April 19, 2023, we recognized total net realized losses of approximately $1 million, with no realized gains or losses recognized from the sale of loans to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM.

In addition, as of April 19, 2023, we had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately $310 million and $190 million, respectively. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by our investment adviser’s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore we believe are likely to close. Investment pipeline includes transactions where due diligence and analysis are in process, but no formal mandate, letter of intent or signed commitment have been issued. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, we may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will sell all or any portion of these investments.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with our risk factors as disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for more information on our critical accounting policies.

Investments

Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.

Effective October 1, 2022, pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, our board of directors selected our investment adviser as our valuation designee to perform the fair value determinations for investments held by us without readily available market quotations.

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (i.e., substantially all of our investments) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, subject to the oversight of our board of directors, based on, among other things, the input of independent third‑party valuation firms that have been engaged to support the valuation of such portfolio investments at least once during a trailing 12‑month period (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter by our investment adviser, and a portion of our investment portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent third-party valuation firm each quarter. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, our valuation process within the context of performing our integrated audit.

As part of the valuation process, our investment adviser may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company’s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets, which may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, our investment adviser considers the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the valuation.

Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it.

In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

Our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, subject to the oversight of our board of directors, undertakes a multi‑step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

•Our quarterly valuation process begins with a preliminary valuation being prepared by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management and valuation team.

•Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed by our investment adviser’s valuation committee.

188

•Our investment adviser’s valuation committee determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the independent third‑party valuation firms, where applicable.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We follow ASC 825-10, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASC 825-10”), which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and a better understanding of the effect of our choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. We have not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled “other assets” and “debt,” which are reported at amortized cost, the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximate fair value.

We also follow ASC 820-10, which expands the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we have considered its principal market as the market in which we exit our portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820-10, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:

•Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.

•Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.

•Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we continue to employ the net asset valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820-10. Consistent with our valuation policy, our investment adviser evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. Our valuation policy considers the fact that because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, the fair value of the investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs.

Our portfolio investments (other than as described below in the following paragraph) are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value (“EV”) of the portfolio company. Enterprise value means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company’s EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. Our investment adviser may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where we do not own a
189

controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, our investment adviser considers the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to the risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.

For other portfolio investments such as investments in the SDLP Certificates and IHAM, discounted cash flow analysis is the primary technique utilized to determine fair value. Expected future cash flows associated with the investment are discounted to determine a present value using a discount rate that reflects estimated market return requirements.

See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for more information on our valuation process.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. Uncertainty with respect to the rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, risks in respect of a failure to increase the U.S. debt ceiling, the war in Ukraine and Russia and the failure of major financial institutions introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility has materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. For additional information concerning these risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see “Risk Factors—General Risk Factors—Global economic, political and market conditions, including uncertainty about the financial stability of the United States, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations”, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Investments—Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Inflation has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2023.

Investment Valuation Risk

Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, subject to the oversight of our board of directors based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged to support the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” as well as Notes 2 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for more information relating to our investment valuation.

Interest Rate Risk
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including the current rising interest rate environment” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2023.
190

 In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below.

As of March 31, 2023, 69% of the investments at fair value in our portfolio bore interest and dividends at variable rates (including our investment in the SDLP Certificates which accounted for 6% of our total investments at fair value), 11% bore interest at fixed rates, 10% were non-income producing, 1% were on non-accrual status and 9% was our equity investment in IHAM which generally pays a quarterly dividend. Additionally, excluding our investment in the SDLP Certificates, 94% of the remaining variable rate investments at fair value contained interest rate floors. The Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Funding Facility, the SMBC Funding Facility and the BNP Funding Facility bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors. The Unsecured Notes and the 2024 Convertible Notes bear interest at fixed rates.
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.

Based on our March 31, 2023 balance sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
191


Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a‑15(e) and 15d‑15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2023. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a‑15(f) and 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
        We are subject to certain legal proceedings, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business. From time to time,
we, our executive officers, directors and our investment adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as
defendants in litigation arising from our investments in our portfolio companies and may, as a result, incur significant costs and
expenses in connection with such litigation. We and our investment adviser are also subject to extensive regulation, which may
result in regulatory proceedings or investigations against us or our investment adviser, respectively. While the outcome of any
such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, neither us nor our investment adviser expect that
any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

Item 1A.     Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and those set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Form N-2, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and in the Form N-2 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

Our business is dependent on bank relationships and recent strain on the banking system may adversely impact us.

The financial markets recently have encountered volatility associated with concerns about the balance sheets of banks, especially small and regional banks who may have significant losses associated with investments that make it difficult to fund demands to withdraw deposits and other liquidity needs. Although the federal government has announced measures to assist these banks and protect depositors, some banks have already been impacted and others may be materially and adversely impacted. Our business is dependent on bank relationships and we are proactively monitoring the financial health of such bank relationships. Continued strain on the banking system may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan

We did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
192


During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as part of our dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders, we did not purchase shares of our common stock in the open market in order to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our dividends.

Stock Repurchase Program

In February 2023, our board of directors authorized an amendment to our existing stock repurchase program to (a) extend the expiration date of the program from February 15, 2023 to February 15, 2024 and (b) increase the amount of the stock repurchase program to a full $500 million. Under the program, we may repurchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our sole discretion, based upon an evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The stock repurchase program will be in effect through February 15, 2024, unless extended or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The stock repurchase program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock or any shares of common stock at all. Consequently, we cannot assure stockholders that any specific number of shares of common stock, if any, will be repurchased under the stock repurchase program. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. See “Recent Developments,” as well as Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 for a subsequent event relating to our stock repurchase program.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, there were no repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of March 31, 2023, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program was $500 million.

Item 3.     Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
 Not applicable.

Item 4.     Mine Safety Disclosures
 Not applicable.

Item 5.    Other Information

Effective as of April 19, 2023, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment, among other things, (a) extended the expiration of the revolving period for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $2.9 billion from March 31, 2026 to April 19, 2027, during which period the Company, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) extended the stated maturity date for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $2.9 billion from March 31, 2027 to April 19, 2028 and (c) extended the stated maturity date for $908 million of the lenders electing to extend their term loan commitments from March 31, 2027 to April 19, 2028. Lenders who elected not to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $150 million, $107 million and $494 million will remain subject to a revolving period expiration of March 30, 2024, March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2026, respectively, and stated maturity dates of March 30, 2025, March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2027, respectively. Lenders who elected not to extend their term loan commitments in an amount equal to $50 million, $28 million and $116 million will remain subject to maturity dates of March 30, 2025, March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2027, respectively.
