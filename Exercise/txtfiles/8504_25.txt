NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021
(UNAUDITED)
  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation
  Description of Business – AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle” or the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AgEagle Aerial, Inc., MicaSense™, Inc. (“MicaSense”), Measure Global, Inc. (“Measure”), senseFly SA, and senseFly Inc. (collectively “senseFly”), is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class autonomous unmanned aerial systems, sensors and software that solve important problems for its customers in a wide range of industry verticals, including energy/utilities, infrastructure, agriculture and government.
  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of MicaSense, Measure and senseFly, respectively. These three business acquisitions are collectively referred to as the “2021 Business Acquisitions.”
  Basis of Presentation – The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the Company has made all necessary adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, for a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. Certain information and disclosures included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 12, 2022. The results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, any other periods or any future year or period.
  Liquidity and Going Concern – In pursuit of the Company’s long-term growth strategy and recent acquisitions the Company has sustained continued operating losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $11,533,356 and used cash in operating activities of $15,342,049. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has working capital of $10,221,025 and an accumulated deficit of $62,587,700. While the Company has historically been successful in raising capital to meet its working capital needs, the ability to continue raising such capital to enable the Company to continue its growth is not guaranteed. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as the Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations for 12 months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. The Company is evaluating strategies to obtain the required additional funding for future operation and the restructuring of operations to grow revenues and reduce expenses.
  If the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation – Continued
  Risks and Uncertainties – Global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, adverse labor market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative impact on the unmanned aerial vehicle (“UAV”) systems industry, the Company’s customers and business globally. The aforementioned risks and their respective impacts on the UAV industry and the Company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. Specifically, as a result of the aforementioned continuing risks, the Company’s ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, the Company’s supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. The Company expects the pandemic, inflation and supply-chain disruptions and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on its business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be for an extended period of time.
  A description of certain of the Company’s accounting policies and other financial information is included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
  Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the reserve for obsolete inventory, valuation of stock issued for services and stock options, valuation of intangible assets including goodwill, foreign currency exchange rates, valuation of defined benefit plan obligations and the valuation of deferred tax assets.
   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures – ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), requires companies to determine fair value based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.
  The guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
  ● Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
    ● Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
    ● Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
  For short-term classes of our financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, their carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The outstanding loans related to the business acquisitions and COVID Loans are carried at face value, which approximates fair value. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
   Inventories – Inventories, which consist of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined by the average-cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials and direct labor. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation primarily includes an analysis of forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, among consideration of other factors. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. Based upon the evaluation, provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company’s estimates and expectations.
  Revenue Recognition and Concentration – The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived primarily through the sales of drone and drone related products and services, sensors and related accessories, and software subscriptions. All contracts and agreements are a fixed price and are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
  The Company generally recognizes revenue on sales to customers, dealers and distributors upon satisfaction of performance obligations which generally occurs once control transfers to customers, which is when product is shipped or delivered depending on specific shipping terms and, where applicable, customer acceptance has been obtained. The fee is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved. The Company records revenue in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, net of any sales, use, value added, or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions and net of any discounts, allowances and returns.
  Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company’s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, it will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. The Company accounts for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
  Additionally, customer payments received in advance of the Company completing performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities. Customer deposits represent customer prepayments and are recognized as revenue when the term of the sale or performance obligation is completed.
  The Company’s software subscriptions to its platforms, HempOverview and Ground Control, are offered on a subscription basis. These subscription fees are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period as the services are provided.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Capitalized Software Development Costs — Software development costs for software to be sold, leased or marketed are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 985-20, Software — Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed. Costs associated with the planning and design phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility has been established, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to customers, and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Amortization is recorded per the individual technology software being released and is included in cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Annual amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining economic life of the software (typically two years). Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a solution are expensed at the date of such determination. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, capitalized software development costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1,301,691 and $995,880, respectively, and are included in intangibles, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
  Internal-use Software Costs — Internal-use software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as research and development costs as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software (typically three to five years). Maintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company reviews the carrying value for impairment whenever facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. Amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs is included in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, capitalized software development costs for internal-use software, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $740,923 and $278,264, respectively, relate to the Company’s implementation of its enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software. Internal-use software costs are included in intangibles, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
  Foreign Currency — The Company translates assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiary, senseFly S.A., to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company translates the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) of its foreign subsidiary at average exchange rates for the applicable period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, arising primarily from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated revenues, certain purchases and intercompany transactions are recorded in other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
  Shipping Costs – All shipping costs billed directly to the customer are directly offset to shipping costs resulting in a net expense to the Company, which is included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, shipping costs were $75,074 and $27,024, respectively, and $220,049 and $62,614, respectively.
  Advertising Costs – Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and presented in sales and marketing expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, advertising costs were $139,480 and $50,941, respectively, and $303,862 and $141,626, respectively.
  Vendor Concentrations – As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was one significant vendor that the Company relies upon to perform certain services for the Company’s technology platform. This vendor provides services to the Company, which can be replaced by alternative vendors should the need arise.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Income (Loss) Per Common Share and Potentially Dilutive Securities – Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus Common Stock, par value $0.001 (“Common Stock”) equivalents (if dilutive) related to warrants, options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and convertible instruments. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had 629,367 of unvested RSUs, 2,484,373 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock, and 6,311 shares of Series F Preferred Stock convertible into 10,179,032 shares of Common Stock, and 16,129,032 Common Stock warrants. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 821,405 unvested RSUs and 2,541,667 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock.
  The following dilutive shares have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2022, 629,367 of unvested RSUs, 727,667 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock, 6,311 shares of Preferred Stock, Series F Convertible into 10,179,032 shares of Common Stock, and 16,129,032 Common Stock warrants. See Note 7 — Equity.
   Segment Reporting – The Company operates in three segments: Drones and Custom Manufacturing, Sensors and Software-as-a Service (“SaaS”).
  Accounting Pronouncements – Adopted – During the first quarter of 2022, the Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”). The update simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by reducing the number of accounting models and limiting the number of embedded conversion features separately recognized from the primary contract. The guidance also includes targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings per share. For smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2022 using the modified retrospective method. Prior to its adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company did not have financial instruments that would have required a cumulative effect to be recognized as an adjustment to its opening balance of accumulated deficit.
  New Accounting Pronouncements – Pending — In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), which addresses areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of its previously issued credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13, that introduced the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires a public business entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables and net investment in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. ASU 2022-02 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and for periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

  Note 4 – Notes Receivable
  Valqari
  On October 14, 2020, in connection with, and as an incentive to the entry into a two-year exclusive manufacturing agreement (the “Manufacturing Agreement”) to produce a patented Drone Delivery Station for Valqari, LLC (“Valqari), the Company entered into, as payee, a Convertible Promissory Note pursuant to which the Company made a loan to Valqari in the principal aggregate amount of $500,000 (the “Note”). The Note accrues interest at a rate of three percent per annum.
  The Note matured on April 15, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time all outstanding principal and interest that had accrued, but remained, unpaid was due. On the Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest, however, Valqari alleged that the Maturity Date was extended to October 14, 2021 (“Extended Maturity Date”) as the Note provided for an automatic six-month extension of the Maturity Date under certain circumstances within the terms and conditions of the Note. Upon the Extended Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest; however, Valqari sought a substantial discount on the amount due under the Note to compensate for alleged breaches by AgEagle under the Manufacturing Agreement. AgEagle disputes the allegations of breach and believes that it is owed a net amount by Valqari under the Manufacturing Agreement, in addition to the amount due under the Note. On November 24, 2021, Valqari made a payment of principal on the Note of $315,000. The parties continue to negotiate in an attempt to reach an amicable resolution of their disputes; however, AgEagle reserves the right to take legal action to collect the Note in the event that a settlement is not reached. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balance remaining under the Note is $185,000.

(“Parrot”) in the principal amount of $100,000. The principal amount owed by Parrot was offset and reduced by all amounts paid or due in connection with the purchase price upon closing of the MicaSense Acquisition.
  senseFly
  On August 25, 2021, and in connection with its acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of senseFly (the senseFly Acquisition”) from Parrot, AgEagle Aerial, as payee, executed a promissory note in the principal amount of $200,000.

The consideration is also subject to a remaining holdback amount of $4,750,000 to cover any post-closing indemnification claims and to satisfy any purchase price adjustments.

The MicaSense Sellers reimbursed the Company for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such registration.
  The MicaSense Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including representations and warranties by the MicaSense Sellers with respect to MicaSense’s business, operations and financial condition. The MicaSense Purchase Agreement also includes post-closing covenants relating to the confidentiality and employee non-solicitation obligations of the MicaSense Sellers, and the agreement of the MicaSense Sellers not to compete with certain aspects of the business of MicaSense following the closing of the transaction. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the MicaSense Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others: (i) the absence of a material adverse effect on MicaSense, (ii) the delivery by the parties of certain ancillary documents, including the registration Rights Agreement, and (iii) the execution by a key employee of MicaSense of an employment agreement. Subject to certain limitations, each of the parties will be indemnified for damages resulting from third party claims and breaches of the parties’ respective representations, warranties, and covenants in the MicaSense Purchase Agreement.

   Note 6 – COVID Loans
  On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted, which included amongst its many provisions, the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). As part of the PPP, qualifying businesses were eligible to receive Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans for use by such businesses for funding payroll, rent and utilities during a designed twenty-four week period through October 21, 2020 (“PPP Loan”). PPP Loans are unsecured, nonrecourse, accrue interest at a rate of one percent per annum, and mature on May 6, 2022. A portion or all of a PPP Loan is forgivable to the extent that an eligible business meets its obligations under the PPP. Additionally, any amounts owed, including unforgiven amounts under the PPP, are payable over two years, though may be extended up to five years upon approval by the SBA.
  On May 6, 2020, AgEagle received a PPP Loan in the amount of $107,439. During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the PPP Loan were forgiven by the SBA.
  In connection with the senseFly Acquisition, the Company assumed the obligations for two COVID Loans originally made by the SBA to senseFly S.A. on July 27, 2020 (“senseFly COVID Loans”). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, no payments of principal and interest were required. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company’s outstanding obligations under the senseFly COVID Loans were $1,014,566 and $1,259,910, respectively.

  Preferred Series F Convertible Stock
  On June 26, 2022 (the “Series F Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Series F Agreement”) with Alpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”). Pursuant to the terms of the Series F Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) designated a new series of Preferred Stock, the Series F 5% Preferred Convertible Stock (“Series F”), and authorized the sale and issuance of up to 35,000 shares of Series F. The Company issued to Alpha 10,000 shares of Series F for an aggregate purchase price and gross proceeds of $10,000,000. The shares of Series F are convertible into 16,129,032 shares of Common Stock at $0.62 per share. Alpha will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of the $1,000 stated par value per share of Series F) of 5% per annum, payable on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, beginning on the first conversion date and subsequent conversion dates.
  In connection with the Series F Agreement the Company issued a warrant to Alpha to purchase 16,129,032 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series F Warrant”) with an exercise price equal to $0.96 per share of Common Stock. The Series F Warrant, and the shares of Common Stock underling the Series F Warrant are collectively referred to as the “Series F Warrant Shares”. The Series F Warrant is not exercisable for the first six months after its issuance and has a three-year term from its exercise date. Upon exercise of the Series F Warrants in full by Alpha, the Company would receive additional gross proceeds of approximately $10,000,000.
  Alpha has the right, subject to certain conditions, including shareholder approval, to purchase up to $25,000,000 of additional shares of Series F and Series F Warrants (collectively the “Series F Option”). The Series F Option will be available for a period of eighteen months after such shareholder approval at a purchase price equal to the average of the volume weighted average price for three trading days prior to the date that Alpha gives notice to the Company that it will exercise the Series F Option.
  Commencing from the Series F Closing Date and for a period of six months thereafter, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, indebtedness or a combination of units thereof (a “Subsequent Financing”), Alpha will have the right to participate in up to an amount of the Subsequent Financing equal to 50% of the Subsequent Financing on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent Financing.
  The Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except that the Company shall not undertake certain corporate actions as set forth in the Certificate of Designation that would materially impact the holders of Preferred Stock without their consent.
  As of September 30, 2022, Alpha had converted 3,689 shares of Series F into 5,950,000 shares of Common Stock and recorded cumulative dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of the $1,000 stated par value per share of Series F) of 5% per annum, beginning on the first conversation date of June 30, 2022, of $94,694.

Subsequent to the aforementioned termination of the consulting agreement, the Consultant sent a demand letter to the Company alleging a breach of this agreement due to the Company’s non-issuance of additional restricted shares of its Common Stock in connection with the Consultant’s alleged achievement of the milestones. As of December 31, 2020, and as a result of this demand, the Company recorded a contingent loss of $1,500,000, based upon the fair market value of $6.00 per share of its Common Stock, which was recorded within professional fees on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded additional stock-based compensation expense of $0 and $1,407,000, respectively, which reflected the issuance of 550,000 additional restricted shares of Common Stock that were subsequently issued on May 12, 2021 as settlement for the claims made under the demand, which resulted in a liability amount of $2,907,000 for purposes of payment of the settlement.

  Overview
  AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle” or the “Company”), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class drones, sensors and software that solve important problems for our customers. Founded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-winged drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. Today, the Company is earning distinction as a globally respected industry leader offering innovative autonomous UAV systems to a wide range of industry verticals, including energy/utilities, infrastructure, agriculture and government, among others.
  The Company’s shift and expansion from solely manufacturing fixed-wing farm drones in 2018, to offering what the Company believes is one of the industry’s best fixed-wing, full-stack drone solutions, culminated in 2021 when AgEagle acquired three market-leading companies engaged in producing UAV airframes, sensors and software for commercial and government use. In addition to a robust portfolio of proprietary, connected hardware and software products, an established global network of nearly 200 UAV resellers and enterprise customers worldwide, these acquisitions also brought AgEagle a highly valuable workforce comprised largely of experienced engineers and technologists with deep expertise in the fields of robotics, automation, manufacturing and data science. Through its efforts to establish three centers of excellence focused on pioneering innovations in flight hardware, sensors and software, AgEagle will continue to produce leading-edge products that serve as catalysts for the creation of new markets for autonomous robotics, while driving material market expansion for the Company’s existing offerings.
  AgEagle is led by a proven management team with years of drone industry experience.
  The Company is headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, where it maintains its U.S. manufacturing operations. In addition, AgEagle has business operations in Austin, Texas; Lausanne, Switzerland; Raleigh, North Carolina; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C.
  Key Growth Strategies
  We intend to materially grow our business by leveraging our proprietary, best-in-class, full-stack drone solutions, industry influence and deep pool of talent with specialized expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data science to achieve greater penetration of the global UAV industry – with near-term emphasis on capturing larger market share of the agriculture, energy/utilities, infrastructure and government/military verticals. We expect to accomplish this goal by first bringing three core values to life in our day-to-day operations and aligning them with our efforts to earn the trust and continued business of our customers and industry partners:
  36
       1. Curiosity – this pushes us to find value where others aren’t looking. It inspires us to see around corners for our customers, understanding the problems they currently face or will be facing in the future, and delivering them solutions best suited for their unique needs.
        2. Passion – this fuels our obsession with excellence, our desire to try the difficult things and tackle big problems, and our commitment to meet our customers’ needs – and then surpass them.
        3. Integrity – this is not optional or situational at AgEagle – it is the foundation for everything we do, even when no one is watching.
  Key components of our growth strategy include the following:
     ● Optimize the strengths of AgEagle’s three centers of excellence with respective expertise in UAV software, sensors and airframes. These centers of excellence will continue to cross-pollinate ideas, industry insights and skillsets to yield intelligent autonomous solutions that effectively demonstrate AgEagle’s experienced team’s specialized knowledge and know-how in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data science.
        ● Deliver new and innovative solutions. AgEagle’s research and development efforts are critical building blocks of the Company, and we intend to continue investing in our own innovations, pioneering new and enhanced products and solutions that enable us to satisfy our customers – both in response to and in anticipation of their needs. AgEagle believes that by investing in research and development, the Company can be a leader in delivering innovative autonomous systems and solutions that address market needs beyond our current target markets, enabling us to create new opportunities for growth.
        ● Growth through acquisition. Through successful execution of our growth-through-acquisition strategies, we intend to acquire technologically advanced UAV companies and intellectual property that complement and strengthen our value proposition to the market. We believe that by investing in complementary acquisitions, we can accelerate our revenue growth and deliver a broader array of innovative autonomous flight systems and solutions that address specialized market needs within our current target markets and in emerging markets that can benefit from innovations in data capture and analytics.
  Competitive Strengths
  AgEagle believes the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
    ● Proprietary technologies, in-house capabilities and industry experience – We believe our decade of experience in commercial UAV design and engineering; in-house manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities; and advanced technology development skillset serve to differentiate AgEagle in the marketplace. In fact, approximately 70% of our global workforce is comprised of engineers and data scientists with deep experience and expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data analytics. In addition, AgEagle is committed to meeting and exceeding quality and safety standards for manufacturing, assembly, design and engineering and testing of drones, drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our Wichita-based and Swiss manufacturing operations.
        ● AgEagle is more than just customer- and product-centric, we are obsessed with innovation and knowing the needs of our customers before they do – We are focused on capitalizing on our specialized expertise in innovating and commercializing advanced drone, sensor and software technologies to provide our existing and future customers with autonomous robotic solutions that meet the highest possible safety and operational standards and fit their specific business needs. We have established three Centers of Excellence that our leadership has challenged to cross-pollinate ideas, industry insights and interdisciplinary skillsets to generate intelligent autonomous solutions that efficiently leverage our expertise in robotics, automation and manufacturing to solve problems for our customers, irrespective of the industry sector in which they may operate.

   Impact of the War in Ukraine and COVID-19 On Our Business Operations
  Global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, adverse labor market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic and other supply chain disruptions continued to have a significant negative impact on the UAV industry, our customers and our business globally. The aforementioned risks and their respective impact on the UAV industry and our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of our control. Specifically, as a result of the aforementioned continuing risks, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture our proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If we or any of our third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply-chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. We expect the pandemic, inflation and supply chain disruptions and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be for an extended period.
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, our supply chain was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and other global economic challenges, causing material delays in the delivery of critical components associated with production of our Altum-PT and RedEdge-P multispectral sensors, introduced to market in the fourth quarter of 2021. These delays resulted in a significant backlog of purchase orders for our sensors. Steps taken in early 2022 to expand our supply sources has allowed us to resolve the majority of our backlogged sensor orders and be better positioned to meet ongoing global market demand in the foreseeable future.  While we believe we have largely overcome our supply chain challenges, this is an ongoing situation we will continue to monitor closely.
  Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 as Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021
  Revenues
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, revenues were $5,490,714 as compared to $2,021,707 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $3,469,007, or 172%. The increase was attributable to the revenues derived from sales of our eBee™ drone products acquired in the senseFly Acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue growth was also positively impacted by continued strong demand for our Altum-PT™ and RedEdge-P™ multispectral sensors, which resulted in total sensor sales rising 71% to $3,256,797 from $1,909,921. In addition, SaaS subscriptions increased 36% to $152,507 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $111,786 for the same three-month period in the prior year. The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to have a negative impact on our business due to global supply chain, inflation and adverse labor market conditions, which could be for an extended period of time. Although we understand that market conditions impacting supply chain are not predictable at this time, we do believe we have made material progress in addressing our backlog of orders for our sensors in the third quarter of this year and expect to full resolve it prior to year-end.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, revenues were $14,620,565, which compared to $5,660,662 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $8,959,903, or 158%. The increase was driven by sales of our eBee drones acquired in the senseFly Acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021, coupled with total sensor sales climbing 19% to $6,283,907 from $5,300,329 and SaaS subscriptions increasing $33% to $480,085 from $360,333. The improvement in SaaS subscriptions was largely attributable to a 207% increase in SaaS software subscriptions for Measure Ground Control, which saw sales rise to $389,406 from $126,804. Offsetting the increase was a decline in SaaS subscriptions sales of HempOverview, which totaled $90,678, down 26% from $121,743.
  38
     Cost of Sales
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, cost of sales totaled $3,407,573 as compared to $1,226,911 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $2,180,662 or 178%. The increase in our cost of sales was attributable to new sales of eBees stemming from the senseFly Acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2021, together with higher sales of our sensor products, coupled with the effects of supply chain constraints, including shortages in electronic components and inflation caused by higher costs to acquire electronic components, increased labor expenses and freight-in costs.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cost of sales was $8,622,436 as compared to $2,885,008 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $5,737,428 or 199%. The increase in our cost of sales was attributable to new sales of eBees, acquired in the senseFly Acquisition in October 2021, and an increase in sensor sales, as well as higher costs associated with the effects of supply chain constraints, including shortages in electronic components and inflation caused by higher costs to acquire electronic components, increased labor expenses and higher freight-in costs.
  Gross Profit
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, gross profit was $2,083,141 as compared to $794,796 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $1,288,345, or 162%. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, gross profit margin was 38% as compared to 39% for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was a result of our senseFly entity drone sales which have lower margins along with an increase in our cost of goods sold for sensor sales over the three months.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, gross profit was $5,998,129 as compared to $2,775,654 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $3,222,475, or 116%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, gross profit margin was 41% as compared to 49% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was a result of our senseFly entity drone sales which have lower margins along with an increase in our cost of goods sold for sensor sales over the nine month period.
  Operating Expenses
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, operating expenses were $7,230,471 as compared to $4,594,330 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $2,636,141, or 57%. Operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, research and development and sales and marketing expenses.

  General and Administrative Expenses
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, general and administrative expenses were $4,175,090 as compared to $2,783,290 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $1,391,800, or 50%. The increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of the newly acquired senseFly businesses, along with continued increases in general and administrative costs from our two other 2021 business acquisitions. These costs primarily included lease expenses, payroll-related costs for new and existing employees, amortization of our acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation expenses, and costs incurred in the design and development of our internal use software.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, general and administrative expenses were $14,093,655 as compared to $10,428,040 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $3,665,615 or 35%. The increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of the newly acquired senseFly businesses, along with continued increases in general and administrative costs from our two other 2021 business acquisitions. These costs primarily included lease expenses, payroll-related costs for new and existing employees, amortization of our acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation expenses and costs incurred for the design and development of our internal use software.
  39
     Research and Development
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, research and development expenses were $1,818,540 as compared to $777,036 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $1,041,504, or 134%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of senseFly and Measure’s research and development teams and technological innovations we are pursuing on our airframes and software solutions.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, research and development expenses were $6,185,777 as compared to $2,115,367 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $4,070,410, or 192%. The increase was attributable to the addition of senseFly’s and Measure’s research and development teams and technological innovations we are pursuing on our airframes and software solutions.
  Sales and Marketing
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, sales and marketing expenses were $1,236,841 as compared to $1,034,004 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $202,837, or 20%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the senseFly and Measure sales and marketing teams.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, sales and marketing expenses were $3,736,548 as compared to $1,813,069 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $1,923,479, or 106%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the senseFly and Measure sales and marketing teams.
  Total Other Income
  For the three months ended September 30, 2022, total other income was $6,812,282, as compared to total other income of $28,632 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The change was primarily attributable to a non-cash gain on debt extinguishment associated with reductions of holdback liabilities in connection with our acquisitions of senseFly and MicaSense, which totaled $6,486,899, in addition to higher other income, net, which climbed to $332,110 from $24,798 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, total other income was $6,484,495 as compared to total other income of $201,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $6,486,899 non-cash gain on debt extinguishment associated with reductions of holdback liabilities in connection with our acquisitions of senseFly and MicaSense realized in the third quarter of 2022, offset by other income generated from the Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness and higher interest income and other income booked for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
   Net Income (Loss)
  For all the aforementioned reasons, the Company achieved net income of $1,664,952 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to a net loss of $3,770,902 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, representing a 144% improvement.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $11,533,356 as compared to a net loss of $11,379,604 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, increasing $153,752, or 1%. In order to achieve our long-term growth strategies, additional resources and investments will be required as we continue to address these shifts by developing new technologies, products and services that support prevailing growth opportunities.
  40
    Cash Flows
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021
  As of September 30, 2022, cash on hand was $5,302,487 as compared to $14,590,566 as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $9,288,079, or 64%.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash used in operations was $15,342,049, an increase of $8,664,328, or 129%, as compared to cash used of $6,677,721 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in cash used in operating activities was principally driven by the operating expenses of our 2021 Business Acquisitions incurred in 2022, which included higher inventory purchases and prepayments, and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Further, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we incurred a non-cash operating gain on debt of extinguishment of $6,486,899.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $8,062,741, a decrease of $22,579,495, or 74%, as compared to cash used of $30,642,236 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in cash used in our investing activities was due to investments in the business acquisitions of MicaSense and Measure in the prior year, offset by the increase in capitalized costs associated with the development of the HempOverview and Measure Ground Control platforms and platforms and the senseFly business acquisition.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $14,577,691, a decrease of $31,023,491, or 68%, as compared to cash provided of $45,601,182 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in cash provided by our financing activities was due to less sales of our Common Stock through an at-the-market (“ATM”) offering and exercise of warrants in the prior year.
  Liquidity and Capital Resources
  As of September 30, 2022, we had working capital of $10,221,025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we incurred a loss from operations of $18,017,851, an increase of $6,437,029, or 56%, as compared to a loss from operations of $11,580,822 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Further, we utilized cash in our operating activities of $15,342,049, an increase of $8,664,328, or 129%, as compared to cash used in operating activities of $6,677,721 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
  On June 26, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company designated a new series of Preferred Stock, the Series F 5% Preferred Convertible Stock (“Series F”), and authorized the sale and issuance of up to 35,000 shares of Series F. The Company issued to an existing investor 10,000 shares of Series F for an aggregate purchase price and gross proceeds of $10,000,000.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we raised $4,583,341 of net proceeds from our ATM offering with co-agents Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Raymond James & Associates.
   The increase in net loss and cash used in operating activities is larger due to the Company’s long-term growth strategy and recent acquisitions which have resulted in additional working capital needs. While the Company has historically been successful in raising capital to meet its working capital needs, the ability to continue raising such capital to enable the Company to continue its growth is not guaranteed. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as the Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations and meet its financial obligations for 12 months from the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. The Company is evaluating strategies to obtain the required additional funding for future operation and the restructuring of operations to grow revenues and reduce expenses.
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
  On September 30, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
  41
    Inflation
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, inflation has had a negative impact on the unmanned aerial vehicle systems industry, our customers, and our business globally. Specifically, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture our proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. In addition, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policies and potentially higher, long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of raising capital in the future.
  Climate Change
  Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.
  New Accounting Pronouncements
  There were certain updates recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
