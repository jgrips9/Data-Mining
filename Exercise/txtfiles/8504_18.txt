NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021
(UNAUDITED)
  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation
  Description of Business – AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle” or the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AgEagle Aerial, Inc, MicaSense™, Inc. (“MicaSense”), Measure Global, Inc. (“Measure”), senseFly SA and senseFly Inc. (collectively “senseFly”), is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class autonomous unmanned aerial systems, sensors and software that solve important problems for its customers in a wide range of industry verticals, including energy/utilities, infrastructure, agriculture and government.
  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of MicaSense, Measure and senseFly, respectively. These three business acquisitions are collectively referred to as the “2021 Business Acquisitions.”
  Basis of Presentation – The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the Company has made all necessary adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, for a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. Certain information and disclosures included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 12, 2022. The results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, any other periods or any future year or period.
  Liquidity – The Company has continued to realize losses from operations. However, because of its capital raise efforts, the Company believes that it will have sufficient cash to meet its anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through August 2023. The Company’s primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s primary source of liquidity is funds generated by financing activities and from private placements. The Company’s ability to fund our operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to make planned acquisitions, to make scheduled debt payments, and to repay or refinance indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
  If the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation – Continued
  Risks and Uncertainties – Global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, adverse labor market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative impact on the unmanned aerial vehicle (“UAV”) systems industry, the Company’s customers and business globally. The aforementioned risks and their respective impacts on the UAV industry and the Company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. Specifically, as a result of the aforementioned continuing risks, the Company’s ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, the Company’s supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. The Company expects the pandemic, inflation and supply-chain disruptions and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on its business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be for an extended period of time.
  Correction of Prior Period Information – During the review of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2021, the Company identified an error in the accounting and presentation of revenue and related expenses recorded for the MicaSense Acquisition (See Note 5 – Business Acquisitions) related to the three months ended March 31, 2021. This error resulted in the recording of $394,743 in additional revenues, $129,510 in additional cost of sales, and $232,252 in additional operating expenses, resulting in additional net income of $32,033. If reported correctly, the Company would have recorded $1,306,849 in revenues, $492,394 in cost of sales, $3,808,236 in operating expenses, and a net loss of ($2,962,563) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Instead, the Company recorded revenues of $1,701,592, cost of sales of $621,904, operating expenses of $4,040,488, and a net loss of ($2,930,530) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. To correct this error, the Company recorded the correction in the three month period ended June 30, 2021. If reported correctly for the three months ended June 30, 2021, then the Company would have reported $2,332,107 in revenues, $1,088,739 in cost of sales, $6,030,872 in operating expenses, and a net loss of ($4,646,139). In accordance with the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 99 and 108 (“SAB 99” and ”SAB 108”), the Company evaluated this error and concluded that although the adjustment to revenue was quantitatively material, the cumulative effects were quantitatively and qualitatively immaterial and would not have materially impacted a reasonable investor’s opinion of the Company. This is further supported by the fact that the impact would not have been significant in comparison to prior periods, as the financial results still supported the Company’s increased year-over-year growth in revenue as reported and discussed in both periods within the Management Discussion & Analysis. Therefore, as permitted by SAB 108 and treated under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, the Company corrected previously recorded results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, to account for the error in this current filing. As a result, the statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflects the corrected revenues, cost of goods sold, operating expenses and net loss.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  A description of certain of the Company’s accounting policies and other financial information is included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
  Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for obsolete inventory, valuation of stock issued for services and stock options, valuation of intangible assets including goodwill, foreign currency exchange rates, valuation of defined benefit plan obligations and the valuation of deferred tax assets.
  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures – ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), requires companies to determine fair value based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.
  The guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
  ● Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
    ● Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
    ● Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
  For short-term classes of our financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable, and which are not reported at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The outstanding loans related to the business acquisitions and COVID Loans are carried at face value, which approximates fair value. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis.
  Inventories – Inventories, which consist of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined by the average-cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials and direct labor. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation primarily includes an analysis of forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, among consideration of other factors. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. Based upon the evaluation, provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company’s estimates and expectations.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Revenue Recognition and Concentration – The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived primarily through the sales of drone and drone related products and services, sensors and related accessories, and software subscriptions. All contracts and agreements are a fixed price and are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
  The Company generally recognizes revenue on sales to customers, dealers and distributors upon satisfaction of performance obligations which generally occurs once controls transfer to customers, which is when product is shipped or delivered depending on specific shipping terms and, where applicable, customer acceptance has been obtained. The fee is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved. The Company records revenue in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, net of any sales, use, value added, or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions and net of any discounts, allowances and returns.
  Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company’s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, it will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. The Company accounts for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
  Additionally, customer payments received in advance of the Company completing performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities. Customer deposits represent customer prepayments and are recognized as revenue when the term of the sale or performance obligation are completed.
  The Company’s software subscriptions to its platforms, HempOverview and Ground Control, are offered on a subscription basis. These subscription fees are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period as the services are provided.
  As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no one customer comprised more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, no one customer comprised more than 10% of revenues.
  Capitalized Software Development Costs — Software development costs for software to be sold, leased or marketed are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 985-20, Software — Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed. Costs associated with the planning and design phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility has been established, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to customers, and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Amortization is recorded per the individual technology software being released and is included in cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Annual amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining economic life of the software (typically two years). Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a solution are expensed at the date of such determination. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, capitalized software development costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1,316,277 and $995,880, respectively, and are included in intangibles, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Internal-use Software Costs — Internal-use software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as research and development costs as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software (typically three to five years). Maintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company reviews the carrying value for impairment whenever facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. Amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs is included in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, capitalized software development costs for internal-use software of $659,906 and $278,264, respectively, relate to the Company’s implementation of its enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software, which was not yet placed into service. Internal-use software costs and are included in intangibles, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
  Foreign Currency — The Company translate assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiary, senseFly S.A., to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company translates the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss of its foreign subsidiary at average exchange rates for the applicable period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, arising primarily from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated revenues, certain purchases and intercompany transactions are recorded in other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
  Shipping Costs – All shipping costs billed directly to the customer are directly offset to shipping costs resulting in a net expense to the Company, which is included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, shipping costs were $85,516 and $9,003, respectively, and $144,975 and $28,900, respectively.
  Advertising Costs – Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and presented in sales and marketing expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, advertising costs were $103,756 and $39,321, respectively, and $164,382 and $90,685, respectively.
  Vendor Concentrations – As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was one significant vendor that the Company relies upon to perform certain services for the Company’s technology platform. This vendor provides services to the Company, which can be replaced by alternative vendors should the need arise.
  Loss Per Common Share and Potentially Dilutive Securities – Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus Common Stock, par value $0.001 (“Common Stock”) equivalents (if dilutive) related to warrants, options, and convertible instruments. For the three and six month ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has excluded all common equivalent shares outstanding for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and options to purchase Common Stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, because these securities are anti-dilutive for the periods presented. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had 675,367 of unvested RSUs, 2,452,248 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock, and 9,690 shares of Preferred Stock, Series F Convertible into 16,129,032 shares of Common Stock, and 16,129,032 Common Stock warrants. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 821,405 unvested RSUs and 2,541,667 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock. See Note 7 — Equity.
  Segment Reporting – The Company operates in three segments: Drones and Custom Manufacturing, Sensors and Software-as-a Service (“SaaS”).

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Accounting Pronouncements – Adopted – During the first quarter of 2022, the Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”). The update simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by reducing the number of accounting models and limiting the number of embedded conversion features separately recognized from the primary contract. The guidance also includes targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings per share. For smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2022 using the modified retrospective method. Prior to its adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company did not have financial instruments that would have required a cumulative effect to be recognized as an adjustment to its opening balance of accumulated deficit.
  New Accounting Pronouncements – Pending — In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), which addresses areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of its previously issued credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13, that introduced the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires a public business entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables and net investment in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. ASU 2022-02 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and for periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

  Note 4 – Notes Receivable
  Valqari
  On October 14, 2020, in connection with, and as an incentive to the entry into a two-year exclusive manufacturing agreement (the “Manufacturing Agreement”) to produce a patented Drone Delivery Station for Valqari, LLC (“Valqari), the Company entered into, as payee, a Convertible Promissory Note pursuant to which the Company made a loan to Valqari in the principal aggregate amount of $500,000 (the “Note”). The Note accrues interest at a rate of three percent per annum.
  The Note matured on April 15, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time all outstanding principal and interest that had accrued, but remained, unpaid was due. On the Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest, however, Valqari alleged that the Maturity Date was extended to October 14, 2021 (“Extended Maturity Date”) as the Note provided for an automatic six-month extension of the Maturity Date under certain circumstances within the terms and conditions of the Note. Upon the Extended Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest; however, Valqari sought a substantial discount on the amount due under the Note to compensate for alleged breaches by AgEagle under the Manufacturing Agreement. AgEagle disputes the allegations of breach and believes that it is owed a net amount by Valqari under the Manufacturing Agreement, in addition to the amount due under the Note. On November 24, 2021, Valqari made a payment of principal on the Note of $315,000. The parties continue to negotiate in an attempt to reach an amicable resolution of their disputes; however, AgEagle reserves the right to take legal action to collect the Note in the event that a settlement is not reached. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the balance remaining under the Note is $185,000.

(“Parrot”) in the principal amount of $100,000. The principal amount owed by Parrot was offset and reduced by all amounts paid or due in connection with the purchase price upon closing of the MicaSense Acquisition.
  senseFly
  On August 25, 2021, and in connection with its acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of senseFly (the senseFly Acquisition”) from Parrot, AgEagle Aerial, as payee, executed a promissory note in the principal amount of $200,000.

  On January 27, 2021 (the “MicaSense Acquisition Date”), the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “MicaSense Purchase Agreement”) with Parrot and Justin B. McAllister (collectively the “MicaSense Sellers”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of MicaSense from the MicaSense Sellers (the “MicaSense Acquisition”). The aggregate purchase price for the shares of MicaSense was $23,000,000, less any debt, and subject to a customary working capital adjustment. A portion of the consideration comprises shares of Common Stock of the Company, having an aggregate value of $3,000,000 based on a volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock over a ten consecutive trading day period prior to the date of issuance of the shares of Common Stock to the MicaSense Sellers. On April 27, 2021 the Company issued 540,541 restricted shares of its Common Stock. The consideration is also subject to a remaining holdback amount of $2,375,000 as of June 30, 2022 to cover any post-closing indemnification claims and to satisfy any purchase price adjustments. The holdback was scheduled to be released in two equal installments, less any amounts paid or reserved for outstanding indemnity claims, on March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023. The first installment of $2,375,000 was paid on March 31, 2022. See Note 11 – Subsequent Events.
  On May 10, 2021, the Company filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement (the “MicaSense Registration Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), covering the resale of the Shares. The MicaSense Registration Statement was declared effective on June 1, 2021 (File Number: 333-255940). In addition, the Company shall use its best efforts to keep the MicaSense Registration Statement effective and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act (including by preparing and filing with the SEC such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and supplements to the MicaSense Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary) until all Shares and other securities covered by the MicaSense Registration Statement have been disposed. The MicaSense Sellers reimbursed the Company for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such registration.
  The MicaSense Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including representations and warranties by the MicaSense Sellers with respect to MicaSense’s business, operations and financial condition. The MicaSense Purchase Agreement also includes post-closing covenants relating to the confidentiality and employee non-solicitation obligations of the MicaSense Sellers, and the agreement of the MicaSense Sellers not to compete with certain aspects of the business of MicaSense following the closing of the transaction. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the MicaSense Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others: (i) the absence of a material adverse effect on MicaSense, (ii) the delivery by the parties of certain ancillary documents, including the registration Rights Agreement, and (iii) the execution by a key employee of MicaSense of an employment agreement. Subject to certain limitations, each of the parties will be indemnified for damages resulting from third party claims and breaches of the parties’ respective representations, warranties, and covenants in the MicaSense Purchase Agreement.
  The Company performed a valuation analysis of the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Using the total consideration for the MicaSense Acquisition, the Company determined the allocations to such assets and liabilities. The final purchase price allocation, and the necessary detailed valuations and calculations have been finalized.

  On April 19, 2021 (the “Measure Acquisition Date”), the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Measure Purchase Agreement”) with Brandon Torres Declet (“Mr. Torres Declet”), in his capacity as Measure Sellers’ representative, and the sellers named in the Measure Purchase Agreement (the “Measure Sellers”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Measure from the Measure Sellers (the “Measure Acquisition”). The aggregate purchase price for the shares of Measure is $45,000,000, less the amount of Measure’s debt and transaction expenses, and subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The purchase price comprised $15,000,000 in cash, and shares of Common Stock of the Company, having an aggregate value of $30,000,000 based on a volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock over a seven consecutive trading day period prior to the date of issuance of the shares of Common Stock to the Measure Sellers. The Company issued 5,319,145 shares of Common Stock, in the aggregate, to the Measure Sellers, and paid $5,000,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price ninety days after the closing date of the transaction. As of December 31, 2021, the Company completed the payment of the cash portion of the purchase price. The consideration is also subject to a $5,625,000 holdback to cover any post-closing indemnification claims and to satisfy any purchase price adjustments. The holdback is scheduled to be released October 19, 2022, less any amounts paid or reserved for outstanding indemnity claims and certain amounts subject to employee retention conditions set forth in the Measure Purchase Agreement.
  The Measure Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including representations and warranties by the Measure Sellers with respect to Measure’s business, operations and financial condition. The Measure Purchase Agreement also includes post-closing covenants relating to the confidentiality and employee non-solicitation obligations of the Measure Sellers, and the agreement of the Measure Sellers not to compete with certain aspects of the business of Measure following the closing of the transaction. The completion of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is subject to: (i) the absence of a material adverse effect on Measure, (ii) the delivery by the parties of certain ancillary documents, and (iii) the execution by key employees of Measure of employment offer letters. Subject to certain limitations, each of the parties will be indemnified for damages resulting from third party claims and breaches of the parties’ respective representations, warranties, and covenants in the Purchase Agreement.
  The Shares issuable to the Measure Sellers pursuant to the Measure Purchase Agreement were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), to a limited number of persons who are “accredited investors” or “sophisticated persons” as those terms are defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC, without the use of any general solicitation or advertising to market or otherwise offer the securities for sale. None of the Shares have been registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws, and none may be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration requirements.
  The Company performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed. Using the total consideration for the Acquisition, the Company estimated the allocations to such assets and liabilities. The final purchase price allocation and the detailed valuations and necessary have been completed.
  The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price as of the Measure Acquisition Date:

  On April 19, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the Measure Purchase Agreement, the Company delivered a notice of indemnification to the representative of the Measure Sellers seeking the right to set off certain operating losses from the holdback amount. The Company is claiming that the operating losses incurred by Measure from the Measure Acquisition date through April 19, 2022, resulted from breaches of certain representations and warranties made by the Measure Sellers. The Company is claiming that it has sustained operating losses in excess of $13 million as a result of the Measure Sellers’ breaches and has claimed the entire holdback amount to be applied against these operating losses. The Company has commenced settlement negotiations with the Measure Sellers. The Company intends to vigorously pursue what it believes are meritorious claims and defend its rights under the Measure Purchase Agreement, but Company management is unable to provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these claims.

  Note 6 – COVID Loans
  On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted, which included amongst its many provisions, the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). As part of the PPP, qualifying businesses were eligible to receive Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans for use by such businesses for funding payroll, rent and utilities during a designed twenty-four week period through October 21, 2020 (“PPP Loan”). PPP Loans are unsecured, nonrecourse, accrue interest at a rate of one percent per annum, and mature on May 6, 2022. A portion or all of a PPP Loan is forgivable to the extent that an eligible business meets its obligations under the PPP. Additionally, any amounts owed, including unforgiven amounts under the PPP, are payable over two years, though may be extended up to five years upon approval by the SBA.
  On May 6, 2020, AgEagle received a PPP Loan in the amount of $107,439. During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the PPP Loan were forgiven by the SBA.
  In connection with the senseFly Acquisition, the Company assumed the obligations for two COVID Loans originally made by the SBA to senseFly S.A. on July 27, 2020 (“senseFly COVID Loans”). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, no payments of principal and interest were required. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company’s outstanding obligations under the senseFly COVID Loans were $1,208,479 and $1,259,910, respectively.

  Preferred Series F Convertible Stock
  On June 26, 2022 (the “Series F Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Series F Agreement”) with Alpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”). Pursuant to the terms of the Series F Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) designated a new series of Preferred Stock, the Series F 5% Preferred Convertible Stock (“Series F”), and authorized the sale and issuance of up to 35,000 shares of Series F. The Company issued to Alpha 10,000 shares of Series F for an aggregate purchase price and gross proceeds of $10,000,000. The shares of Series F are convertible into 16,129,032 shares of Common Stock at $0.62 per share. Alpha will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of the $1,000 stated par value per share of Series F) of 5% per annum, payable on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, beginning on the first conversion date and subsequent conversion dates.
  In connection with the Series F Agreement the Company issued a warrant to Alpha to purchase 16,129,032 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series F Warrant”) with an exercise price equal to $0.96 per share of Common Stock. The Series F Warrant, and the shares of Common Stock underling the Series F Warrant are collectively referred to as the “Series F Warrant Shares”. The Series F Warrant is not exercisable for the first six months after its issuance and has a three-year term from its exercise date. Upon exercise of the Series F Warrants in full by Alpha, the Company would receive additional gross proceeds of approximately $10,000,000.
  Alpha has the right, subject to certain conditions, including shareholder approval, to purchase up to $25,000,000 of additional shares of Series F and Series F Warrants (collectively the “Series F Option”). The Series F Option will be available for a period of eighteen months after such shareholder approval at a purchase price equal to the average of the volume weighted average price for three trading days prior to the date that Alpha gives notice to the Company that it will exercise the Series F Option.
  Commencing from the Series F Closing Date and for a period of six months thereafter, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, indebtedness or a combination of units thereof (a “Subsequent Financing”), Alpha will have the right to participate in up to an amount of the Subsequent Financing equal to 50% of the Subsequent Financing on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the Subsequent Financing.
  The Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except that the Company shall not undertake certain corporate actions as set forth in the Certificate of Designation that would materially impact the holders of Preferred Stock without their consent.
  As of June 30, 2022, Alpha had converted 310 shares of Series F into 500,000 shares of Common Stock. See Note 11 – Subsequent Events.

Subsequent to the aforementioned termination of the consulting agreement, the Consultant sent a demand letter to the Company alleging a breach of this agreement due to the Company’s non-issuance of additional restricted shares of its Common Stock in connection with the Consultant’s alleged achievement of the milestones. As of December 31, 2020, and as a result of this demand, the Company recorded a contingent loss of $1,500,000, based upon the fair market value of $6.00 per share of its Common Stock, which was recorded within professional fees on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Upon exercise of the Warrants in full by the Investor, the Company would receive additional gross proceeds of $8,305,368. The shares of Common Stock of the Company underlying the Warrants are referred to as “August Warrant Shares.”
  The purchase price for each share of Common Stock is $2.98. Net proceeds from the sale were used for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The shares of Common Stock, the August Warrants and the August Warrant Shares were offered by the Company pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239157), which was declared effective on June 19, 2020.

  Overview
  AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle” or the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class drones, sensors and software that solve important problems for our customers. Founded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-winged drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. Today, the Company is earning distinction as a globally respected industry leader offering best-in-class, autonomous UAV systems to a wide range of industry verticals, including energy/utilities, infrastructure, agriculture and government, among others.
  The Company’s shift and expansion from solely manufacturing fixed-wing farm drones in 2018, to offering what the Company believes is one of the industry’s best fixed-wing, full-stack drone solutions, culminated in 2021 when AgEagle acquired three market-leading companies engaged in producing UAV airframes, sensors and software for commercial and government use. In addition to a robust portfolio of proprietary, connected hardware and software products, an established global network of nearly 200 UAV resellers, and enterprise customers worldwide, these acquisitions also brought AgEagle a highly valuable workforce comprised largely of experienced engineers and technologists with deep expertise in the fields of robotics, automation, manufacturing and data science.
  AgEagle is led by a proven management team with years of drone industry experience. In view of AgEagle’s participation in the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee, and its participation in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s BEYOND program, AgEagle has played a hands-on role in helping to establish necessary rulemaking guidelines and regulations for the future of autonomous flight and the full integration of drones into the U.S. airspace.
  The Company is headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, where it maintains its U.S. manufacturing operations. In addition, AgEagle has business operations in Austin, Texas; Lausanne, Switzerland; Raleigh, North Carolina; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C.
  Key Growth Strategies
  We intend to materially grow our business by leveraging our proprietary, best-in-class, full-stack drone solutions, industry influence and deep pool of talent with specialized expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data science to achieve greater penetration of the global UAV industry – with near-term emphasis on capturing larger market share of the agriculture, energy/utilities, infrastructure and government/military verticals. We expect to accomplish this goal by first bringing three core values to life in our day-to-day operations and aligning them with our efforts to earn the trust and continued business of our customers and industry partners:
  34
       1. Curiosity – this pushes us to find value where others aren’t looking. It inspires us to see around corners for our customers, understanding the problems they currently face or will be facing in the future, and delivering them solutions best suited for their unique needs.
    2. Passion – this fuels our obsession with excellence, our desire to try the difficult things and tackle big problems, and our commitment to meet our customers’ needs – and then surpass them.
    3. Integrity – this is not optional or situational at AgEagle – it is the foundation for everything we do, even when no one is watching.
  Key components of our growth strategy include the following:
    ● Establish three centers of excellence with respective expertise in UAV software, sensors and airframes. These centers of excellence will cross pollinate ideas, industry insights and skillsets to yield intelligent autonomous solutions that fully leverage AgEagle’s experienced team’s specialized knowledge and know-how in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data science.
    ● Deliver new and innovative solutions. AgEagle’s research and development efforts are critical building blocks of the Company, and we intend to continue investing in our own innovations, pioneering new and enhanced products and solutions that enable us to satisfy our customers – both in response to and in anticipation of their needs. AgEagle believes that by investing in research and development, the Company can be a leader in delivering innovative autonomous systems and solutions that address market needs beyond our current target markets, enabling us to create new opportunities for growth.
    ● Growth through acquisition. Through successful execution of our growth-through-acquisition strategies, we intend to acquire technologically advanced UAV companies and intellectual property that complement and strengthen our value proposition to the market. We believe that by investing in complementary acquisitions, we can accelerate our revenue growth and deliver a broader array of innovative autonomous flight systems and solutions that address specialized market needs within our current target markets and in emerging markets that can benefit from innovations in artificial intelligence-enabled robotics and data capture and analytics.
  Competitive Strengths
  AgEagle believes the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
    ● Proprietary technologies, in-house capabilities and industry experience – We believe our decade of experience in commercial UAV design and engineering; in-house manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities; and advanced technology development skillset serve to differentiate AgEagle in the marketplace. In fact, approximately 70% of our Company’s global workforce is comprised of engineers and data scientists with deep experience and expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data analytics. In addition, AgEagle is committed to meeting and exceeding quality and safety standards for manufacturing, assembly, design and engineering and testing of drones, drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our Wichita-based and Swiss manufacturing operations.
    ● AgEagle is more than just customer- and product-centric, we are obsessed with innovation and knowing the needs of our customers before they do – We are focused on capitalizing on our specialized expertise in innovating and commercializing advanced drone, sensor and software technologies to provide our existing and future customers with autonomous robotic solutions that meet the highest possible safety and operational standards and fit their specific business needs. We have established three Centers of Excellence that our leadership has challenged to cross-pollinate ideas, industry insights and interdisciplinary skillsets to generate intelligent autonomous solutions that efficiently leverage our expertise in robotics, automation and manufacturing to solve problems for our customers, irrespective of the industry sector in which they may operate.
  35
      ● We offer market-tested drones, sensors and software solutions that have earned the longstanding trust and fidelity of customers worldwide – through successful execution of our acquisition strategy in 2021, AgEagle is now delivering a unified line of industry trusted drones, sensors and software that have been vigorously tested and consistently proven across multiple industry verticals and use cases. For instance, our line of eBee fixed wing drones, pioneered by senseFly, have flown more than one million flights over the past decade serving customers spanning surveying and mapping; engineering and construction; military/defense; mining, quarries and aggregates; agriculture humanitarian aid and environmental monitoring, among just a few. Featured in over 100 research publications globally, advanced sensor innovations developed and commercialized by MicaSense, have served to forge new industry standards for high performance, high resolution, thermal and multispectral imaging for commercial drone applications in agriculture, plant research, land management and forestry. In addition, we have championed the development of end-to-end software solutions which power autonomous flight and deliver actionable, contextual data and analytics for a who’s who of Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and a wide range of businesses in agriculture, energy and utilities, construction and other industry sectors.
  Impact of the War in Ukraine and COVID-19 On Our Business Operations
  Global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, adverse labor market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative impact on the UAV industry, our customers, and our business globally. The aforementioned risks and their respective impacts on the UAV industry and our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of our control. Specifically, as a result of the aforementioned continuing risks, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply-chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. We expect the pandemic, inflation and supply chain disruptions and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be for an extended period.
  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, our supply chain was adversely impacted by the pandemic, causing material delays in the delivery of critical supply orders associated with timely fulfilling our obligations to our large ecommerce client. As a consequence, significant inventory purchases were made in 2021 in order to secure the manufacturing of our products in an effort to prevent delays in 2022. This is an on-going situation that we continue to monitor closely.

The increase was attributable to the revenues derived from our ebee drone products acquired in the senseFly Acquisition. Offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues of $70,946 for our SaaS subscription services related to the HempOverview and Ground Control Platforms. The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to have a negative impact on our business due to global supply chain, inflation and adverse labor market conditions, which could be for an extended period of time Although we understand that market conditions impacting supply chain are not predictable at this time, we do believe that our backlog in sales will be resolved by no later than the end of the third quarter 2022.

Offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues of $363,298 related to our sensor sales, specifically the RedEdge and Altum™ sensor products. The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects continue to have a negative impact on the business due to supply chain, inflation and adverse labor market conditions, which could be for an extended period of time.

The increase in cash used in operating activities was principally driven by the operating expenses of our 2021 Business Acquisitions, which included higher inventory purchases and prepayments, and accounts payable, offset by deferred revenue resulting in customer backlog for prepayments on future sales.
  For the six months ended June 30, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $4,004,092, a decrease of $20,557,665, or 83.7%, as compared to cash used of $24,561,757 for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources
  As of June 30, 2022, we had working capital of $8,774,304. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we incurred a loss from operations of $12,870,519, an increase of $5,089,231, or 65.4%, as compared to a loss from operations of $7,781,288 for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

     Inflation
  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, inflation has had a negative impact on the unmanned aerial vehicle systems industry, our customers, and our business globally. Specifically, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture our proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. In addition, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policies and potentially higher, long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of raising capital in the future.
  Climate Change
  Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.
  New Accounting Pronouncements
  There were certain updates recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
