    AGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022 AND 2021
(UNAUDITED)
  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation
  Description of Business – AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle” or the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AgEagle Aerial, Inc, MicaSense™, Inc. (“MicaSense”), Measure Global, Inc. (“Measure”), senseFly SA and senseFly Inc. (collectively “senseFly”), is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class autonomous unmanned aerial systems, sensors and software that solve important problems for its customers in a wide range of industry verticals, including energy/utilities, infrastructure, agriculture and government.
  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a 100% of the outstanding stock of MicaSense, Measure and senseFly, respectively. These three business acquisitions are collectively referred to as the “2021 Business Acquisitions”.
  Basis of Presentation – The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the Company has made all necessary adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, for a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. Certain information and disclosures included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in the Company’s annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 12, 2022. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, any other periods or any future year or period.
  Liquidity – The Company has continued to realize losses from operations. However, because of its capital raise efforts, the Company believes that it will have sufficient cash to meet its anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through March 2023. The Company’s primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s primary source of liquidity is funds generated by financing activities and from private placements. The Company’s ability to fund our operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to make planned acquisitions, to make scheduled debt payments, and to repay or refinance indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
  If the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
  Risks and Uncertainties – Global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, adverse labor market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative impact on the unmanned aerial vehicle (“UAV”) systems industry, the Company’s customers and business globally. The aforementioned risks and their respective impacts on the UAV industry and the Company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. Specifically, as a result of the aforementioned continuing risks, the Company’s ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, the Company’s supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. The Company expects the pandemic, inflation and supply-chain disruptions and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on its business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be for an extended period of time.

  Note 1 – Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation- Continued
  Correction of Prior Period Information – During the review of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2021, the Company identified an error in the accounting and presentation of revenue and related expenses recorded for the MicaSense Acquisition related to the three months ended March 31, 2021. This error resulted in the recording of $394,743 in additional revenues, $129,510 in additional cost of sales, and $232,252 in additional operating expenses, resulting in additional net income of $32,033. If reported correctly, the Company would have recorded $1,306,849 in revenues, $492,394 in cost of sales, $3,808,236 in operating expenses, and a net loss of ($2,962,563) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Instead, the Company recorded revenues of $1,701,592, cost of sales of $621,904, operating expenses of $4,040,488, and a net loss of ($2,930,530) for the three months ended March 31, 2021. To correct this error, the Company recorded the correction in the three month period ended June 30, 2021. If reported correctly for the three months ended June 30, 2021, then the Company would have reported $2,332,107 in revenues, $1,088,739 in cost of sales, $6,030,872 in operating expenses, and a net loss of ($4,646,139). In accordance with the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 99 and 108 (“SAB 99” and ”SAB 108”), the Company evaluated this error and concluded that although the adjustment to revenue was quantitatively material, the cumulative effects were quantitatively and qualitatively immaterial and would not have materially impacted a reasonable investor’s opinion of the Company. This is further supported by the fact that the impact would not have been significant in comparison to prior periods, as the financial results still supported the Company’s increased year-over-year growth in revenue as reported and discussed in both periods within the Management Discussion & Analysis. Therefore, as permitted by SAB 108 and treated under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, the Company corrected previously recorded results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, to account for the error in this current filing. As a result, the statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflects the corrected revenues, cost of goods sold, operating expenses and net loss.
  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  A description of certain of the Company’s accounting policies and other financial information is included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. 
   Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for obsolete inventory, valuation of stock issued for services and stock options, valuation of intangible assets including goodwill, foreign currency exchange rates, valuation of defined benefit plan obligations and the valuation of deferred tax assets.
  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures – ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), requires companies to determine fair value based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.
  The guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
  ● Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
    ● Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
    ● Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
  For short-term classes of our financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable, and which are not reported at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The outstanding loan owed under the Paycheck Protection Program Loan (“PPP Loan”) is carried at face value, which approximates fair value. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis.
  Inventories – Inventories, which consist of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined by the average-cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials and direct labor. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation primarily includes an analysis of forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, among consideration of other factors. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. Based upon the evaluation, provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company’s estimates and expectations.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Revenue Recognition and Concentration – The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived primarily through the sales of drone and drone related products and services, sensors and related accessories, and software subscriptions. All contracts and agreements are a fixed price and are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
  The Company generally recognizes revenue on sales to customers, dealers, and distributors upon satisfaction of performance obligations which generally occurs once controls transfer to customers, which is when product is shipped or delivered depending on specific shipping terms and, where applicable, a customer acceptance has been obtained. The fee is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved. The Company records revenue in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, net of any sales, use, value added, or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions and net of any discounts, allowances and returns.
  Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company’s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, it will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. The Company accounts for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
  Additionally, customer payments received in advance of the Company completing performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities. Customer deposits represent customer prepayments and are recognized as revenue when the term of the sale or performance obligation are completed.
  The Company’s software subscriptions to its platforms, HempOverview and Ground Control, are offered on a subscription basis. These subscription fees are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period as the services are provided.
   As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no one customer comprised more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, net. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, no one customer comprised more than 10% of revenues. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, one customer comprised 93.7% of revenues.
  Capitalized Software Development Costs - Software development costs for software to be sold, leased or marketed are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 985-20, Software — Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed. Costs associated with the planning and design phase of software development are classified as research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility has been established, a portion of the costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and quality assurance, are capitalized until available for general release to customers, and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Amortization is recorded per the individual technology software being released and is included in cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Annual amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining economic life of the software (typically two years). Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a solution are expensed at the date of such determination. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, capitalized software development costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1,244,492 and $995,880, respectively, and are included in intangibles, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

  Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Continued
  Internal-use Software Costs - Internal-use software development costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, Internal-Use Software. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as research and development costs as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software (typically three to five years). Maintenance and enhancement costs, including those costs in the post-implementation stages, are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the software that result in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company reviews the carrying value for impairment whenever facts and circumstances exist that would suggest that assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. Amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software development costs is included in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, capitalized software development costs for internal-use software of $450,171 and $278,264, respectively, relate to the Company’s implementation of its enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software, which was not yet placed into service. The Company expects to place its ERP into service during the three months ending June 30, 2022. Internal-use software costs and are included in intangibles, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
  Foreign Currency - The Company translate assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiary, senseFly S.A., to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company translates the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss of its foreign subsidiary at average exchange rates for the applicable period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, arising primarily from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated revenues, certain purchases and intercompany transactions are recorded in other (expense) income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, foreign currency transaction losses, net were $98,299 and $0, respectively.
  Shipping Costs – All shipping costs billed directly to the customer are directly offset to shipping costs resulting in a net expense to the Company, which is included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, shipping costs were $59,458 and $19,897, respectively.
  Advertising Costs – Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and presented in sales and marketing expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, advertising costs were $60,626 and $26,650, respectively.
  Vendor Concentrations – As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was one significant vendor that the Company relies upon to perform certain services for the Company’s technology platform. This vendor provides services to the Company, which can be replaced by alternative vendors should the need arise.
  Loss Per Common Share and Potentially Dilutive Securities – Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus Common Stock, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”) equivalents (if dilutive) related to warrants, options, and convertible instruments. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has excluded all common equivalent shares outstanding for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and options to purchase Common Stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, because these securities are anti-dilutive for the periods presented. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had 740,748 unvested RSUs and 2,558,497 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 821,405 unvested RSUs and 2,541,667 options outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock.
  Segment Reporting – The Company operates in three segments: Drones and Custom Manufacturing, Sensors and Software-as-a Service (“SaaS”).

  New Accounting Pronouncements – Pending - In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”), which addresses areas identified by the FASB as part of its post-implementation review of its previously issued credit losses standard, ASU 2016-13, that introduced the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted the CECL model and enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings made with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, ASU 2022-02 requires a public business entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs for financing receivables and net investment in leases by year of origination in the vintage disclosures. ASU 2022-02 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and for periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 – Notes Receivable
  Valqari
  On October 14, 2020, in connection with, and as an incentive to the entry into a two-year exclusive manufacturing agreement (the “Manufacturing Agreement”) to produce a patented Drone Delivery Station for Valqari, LLC (“Valqari), the Company entered into, as payee, a Convertible Promissory Note pursuant to which the Company made a loan to Valqari in the principal aggregate amount of $500,000 (the “Note”). The Note accrues interest at a rate of three percent per annum.
  The Note matured on April 15, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time all outstanding principal and interest that had accrued, but remained, unpaid was due. On the Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest, however, Valqari alleged that the Maturity Date was extended to October 14, 2021 (“Extended Maturity Date”) as the Note provided for an automatic six-month extension of the Maturity Date under certain circumstances within the terms and conditions of the Note. Upon the Extended Maturity Date, AgEagle demanded payment of the Note, including accrued interest; however, Valqari sought a substantial discount on the amount due under the Note to compensate for alleged breaches by AgEagle under the Manufacturing Agreement. AgEagle disputes the allegations of breach and believes that it is owed a net amount by Valqari under the Manufacturing Agreement, in addition to the amount due under the Note. On November 24, 2021, Valqari made a payment of principal on the Note of $315,000. The parties continue to negotiate in an attempt to reach an amicable resolution of their disputes; however, AgEagle reserves the right to take legal action to collect the Note in the event that a settlement is not reached.
  MicaSense
  On November 16, 2020, and in connection with its January 27, 2021 acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of MicaSense (“MicaSense Acquisition), AgEagle, as payee, executed a promissory note with Parrot Drones S.A.S. in the principal amount of $100,000. The principal amount owed by Parrot Drones S.A.S. was offset and reduced by all amounts paid or due in connection with the purchase price upon closing of the MicaSense Acquisition.
  senseFly
  On August 25, 2021, and in connection with its acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of senseFly (the senseFly Acquisition”) from Parrot Drones S.A.S., AgEagle Aerial, as payee, executed a promissory note in the principal amount of $200,000. The principal amount owed by Parrot Drones S.A.S. was off-set and reduced by all amounts paid or due in connection with the purchase price upon closing of the senseFly Acquisition.
  Note 5 – Business Acquisitions
  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the capital stock of MicaSense, Measure and senseFly, respectively. The financial results of each of these acquisitions are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective acquisition dates.
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, transaction costs related to business combinations totaled $0 and $147,764 respectively, which are included within general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

  MicaSense
  On January 27, 2021 (the “MicaSense Acquisition Date”), the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “MicaSense Purchase Agreement”) with Parrot Drones S.A.S. and Justin B.

   Note 6 – COVID Loans
  On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted, which included amongst its many provisions, the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). As part of the PPP, qualifying businesses were eligible to receive Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans for use by such businesses for funding payroll, rent and utilities during a designed twenty-four week period through October 21, 2020 (“PPP Loan”). PPP Loans are unsecured, nonrecourse, accrue interest at a rate of one percent per annum, and mature on May 6, 2022. A portion or all of a PPP Loan is forgivable to the extent that an eligible business meets its obligations under the PPP. Additionally, any amounts owed, including unforgiven amounts under the PPP, are payable over two years, though may be extended up to five years upon approval by the SBA.
  On May 6, 2020, AgEagle received a PPP Loan in the amount of $107,439. During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the PPP Loan were forgiven by the SBA.
  In connection with the senseFly Acquisition, the Company assumed the obligations for two COVID Loans originally made by the SBA to senseFly S.A. on July 27, 2020 (“senseFly COVID Loans”). For the three months ended March 31, 2022, no payments of principal and interest were required. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company’s outstanding obligations under the senseFly COVID Loans were $1,248,461 and $1,259,910, respectively.

On October 31, 2019, the consulting agreement was terminated; however, the Consultant continued to be entitled to receive up to 2,500,000 restricted Common Stock after termination of the consulting agreement, if the achievement of milestones that commenced during the term of the consulting agreement were completed within twenty-four months. Subsequent to the aforementioned termination of the consulting agreement, the Consultant sent a demand letter to the Company alleging a breach of this agreement due to the Company’s non-issuance of additional restricted shares of its Common Stock in connection with the Consultant’s alleged achievement of the milestones. As of December 31, 2020, and as a result of this demand, the Company recorded a contingent loss of $1,500,000, based upon the fair market value of $6.00 per share of its Common Stock, which was recorded within professional fees on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded additional stock-based compensation expense of $1,407,000, which reflected the issuance of 550,000 additional restricted shares of Common Stock that were subsequently issued on May 12, 2021, which resulted in a liability amount of $2,907,000 for purposes of payment of the settlement.

  Overview
  AgEagle™ Aerial Systems Inc. (“AgEagle” or the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is actively engaged in designing and delivering best-in-class drones, sensors and software that solve important problems for our customers. Founded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-winged drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. Today, the Company is earning distinction as a globally respected industry leader offering best-in-class, autonomous UAV systems to a wide range of industry verticals, including energy/utilities, infrastructure, agriculture and government, among others.
  The Company’s shift and expansion from solely manufacturing fixed-wing farm drones in 2018, to offering what the Company believes is one of the industry’s best fixed-wing, full-stack drone solutions, culminated in 2021 when AgEagle acquired three market-leading companies engaged in producing UAV airframes, sensors and software for commercial and government use. In addition to a robust portfolio of proprietary, connected hardware and software products, an established global network of nearly 200 UAV resellers, and enterprise customers worldwide, these acquisitions also brought AgEagle a highly valuable workforce comprised largely of experienced engineers and technologists with deep expertise in the fields of robotics, automation, manufacturing and data science.
  AgEagle is led by a proven management team with years of drone industry experience. In view of AgEagle’s participation in the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Aviation Rulemaking Committee, and its participation in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s BEYOND program, AgEagle has played a hands-on role in helping to establish necessary rulemaking guidelines and regulations for the future of autonomous flight and the full integration of drones into the U.S. airspace.
  The Company is headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, where it maintains its U.S. manufacturing operations. In addition, AgEagle has business operations in Austin, Texas; Lausanne, Switzerland; Raleigh, North Carolina; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C.
  Key Growth Strategies
  We intend to materially grow our business by leveraging our proprietary, best-in-class, full-stack drone solutions, industry influence and deep pool of talent with specialized expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data science to achieve greater penetration of the global UAV industry – with near-term emphasis on capturing larger market share of the agriculture, energy/utilities, infrastructure and government/military verticals. We expect to accomplish this goal by first bringing three core values to life in our day-to-day operations and aligning them with our efforts to earn the trust and continued business of our customers and industry partners:
  26 
      1. Curiosity – this pushes us to find value where others aren’t looking. It inspires us to see around corners for our customers, understanding the problems they currently face or will be facing in the future, and delivering them solutions best suited for their unique needs.
    2. Passion – this fuels our obsession with excellence, our desire to try the difficult things and tackle big problems, and our commitment to meet our customers’ needs – and then surpass them.
    3. Integrity – this is not optional or situational at AgEagle – it is the foundation for everything we do, even when no one is watching.
   Key components of our growth strategy include the following:
     ● Establish three centers of excellence with respective expertise in UAV software, sensors and airframes. These centers of excellence will cross pollinate ideas, industry insights and skillsets to yield intelligent autonomous solutions that fully leverage AgEagle’s experienced team’s specialized knowledge and know-how in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data science.
    ● Deliver new and innovative solutions. AgEagle’s research and development efforts are critical building blocks of the Company, and we intend to continue investing in our own innovations, pioneering new and enhanced products and solutions that enable us to satisfy our customers – both in response to and in anticipation of their needs. AgEagle believes that by investing in research and development, the Company can be a leader in delivering innovative autonomous systems and solutions that address market needs beyond our current target markets, enabling us to create new opportunities for growth.
    ● Growth through acquisition. Through successful execution of our growth-through-acquisition strategies, we intend to acquire technologically advanced UAV companies and intellectual property that complement and strengthen our value proposition to the market. We believe that by investing in complementary acquisitions, we can accelerate our revenue growth and deliver a broader array of innovative autonomous flight systems and solutions that address specialized market needs within our current target markets and in emerging markets that can benefit from innovations in artificial intelligence-enabled robotics and data capture and analytics.
   Competitive Strengths
  AgEagle believes the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
     ● Proprietary technologies, in-house capabilities and industry experience – We believe our decade of experience in commercial UAV design and engineering; in-house manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities; and advanced technology development skillset serve to differentiate AgEagle in the marketplace. In fact, approximately 70% of our Company’s global workforce is comprised of engineers and data scientists with deep experience and expertise in robotics, automation, custom manufacturing and data analytics. In addition, AgEagle is committed to meeting and exceeding quality and safety standards for manufacturing, assembly, design and engineering and testing of drones, drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our Wichita-based and Swiss manufacturing operations.
    ● AgEagle is more than just customer- and product-centric, we are obsessed with innovation and knowing the needs of our customers before they do – We are focused on capitalizing on our specialized expertise in innovating and commercializing advanced drone, sensor and software technologies to provide our existing and future customers with autonomous robotic solutions that meet the highest possible safety and operational standards and fit their specific business needs. We have established three Centers of Excellence that our leadership has challenged to cross-pollinate ideas, industry insights and interdisciplinary skillsets to generate intelligent autonomous solutions that efficiently leverage our expertise in robotics, automation and manufacturing to solve problems for our customers, irrespective of the industry sector in which they may operate.
  27 
      ● We offer market-tested drones, sensors and software solutions that have earned the longstanding trust and fidelity of customers worldwide – through successful execution of our acquisition strategy in 2021, AgEagle is now delivering a unified line of industry trusted drones, sensors and software that have been vigorously tested and consistently proven across multiple industry verticals and use cases. For instance, our line of eBee fixed wing drones, pioneered by senseFly, have flown more than one million flights over the past decade serving customers spanning surveying and mapping; engineering and construction; military/defense; mining, quarries and aggregates; agriculture humanitarian aid and environmental monitoring, among just a few. Featured in over 100 research publications globally, advanced sensor innovations developed and commercialized by MicaSense, have served to forge new industry standards for high performance, high resolution, thermal and multispectral imaging for commercial drone applications in agriculture, plant research, land management and forestry. In addition, we have championed the development of end-to-end software solutions which power autonomous flight and deliver actionable, contextual data and analytics for a who’s who of Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and a wide range of businesses in agriculture, energy and utilities, construction and other industry sectors.
   Impact of COVID-19 On Our Business Operations
  Global economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions, adverse labor market conditions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative impact on the UAV industry, our customers, and our business globally. The aforementioned risks and their respective impacts on the UAV industry and our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and outside of our control. Specifically, as a result of the aforementioned continuing risks, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. We expect the pandemic, inflation and supply-chain disruptions and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on its business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be for an extended period of time.
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, our supply chain was adversely impacted by the pandemic, causing material delays in the delivery of critical supply orders associated with timely fulfilling our obligations to our large ecommerce client. As a consequence, significant inventory purchases were made in 2021 in order to secure the manufacturing of our products in an effort to prevent delays in 2022. This is an on-going situation that we continue to monitor closely.
  Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 as Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2021
  Revenues
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, revenues were $3,841,978 as compared to $1,701,592 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $2,140,386, or 125.8%. The increase of $2,738,982 was attributable to the revenues derived from our ebee drone products as a result of the senseFly acquisition and $149,975 of increased sales of our SaaS subscription services related to the HempOverview and Ground Control platforms. Offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues of $748,571 related to our sensor sales, specifically the RedEdge and Altum™ sensor products due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects that continue to have a negative impact on the business due to supply chain, inflation and adverse labor market conditions, which could be for an extended period of time.
    28 
    Cost of Sales
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, cost of sales was $2,477,086 as compared to $621,904 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $1,855,182, or 298.3%. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, gross profit was $1,364,892 as compared the $1,079,688 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $285,204, or 26.4%. The primary factors contributing to the increase in our cost of sales and decrease in gross profit margin were due to the increase in our cost of components and parts brought forth by the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated negative effects on supply chain, inflation and adverse labor market conditions, and a continued shift in our product mix as a result of the MicaSense and senseFly acquisitions, both of which resulted in lower gross profit margins.
  Operating Expenses
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, operating expenses were $8,846,833, as compared to $4,040,488 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $4,806,345, or 119.0%. Operating expenses comprise general and administrative, professional fees, sales and marketing and research and development.

  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses were $5,481,380 as compared to $3,509,979 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $1,971,401, or 56.2%. The increase was primarily as a result of the inclusion of the newly acquired senseFly businesses, along with continued increases in general and administrative costs from all of the other 2021 business acquisitions. These costs primarily included lease expenses, payroll-related costs for new and existing employees, amortization of our acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation expenses, offset by a decrease in professional fees, related mainly to legal and consulting fees.
  Research and Development
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, research and development expenses were $2,184,924 as compared to $232,804 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $1,952,120, or 838.5%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of senseFly and Measure’s research and development teams that provide development of our new airframe and software technologies.
  Sales and Marketing
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses were $1,180,529 as compared to $297,705 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $882,824, or 296.5%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the senseFly and Measure sales and marketing teams.
  Other Expense/(Income), net
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, other expense, net was $114,631 as compared to other income, net of $30,270 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The change was primarily attributable to the net foreign currency transaction losses incurred by senseFly.
  Net Loss
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss of $7,596,572 as compared to a net loss of $2,930,530 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of $4,666,042, or 159.2%. The overall increase in net loss was primarily attributable to greater operating and transactional costs as a result of the 2021 Business Acquisitions and a decrease in gross profit margins due to supply chain constraints. In addition, in order to achieve our long-term growth strategies additional resources and investments will be required as we continue to address these shifts by developing new technologies, products and services that support prevailing growth opportunities.

    Cash Flows
  Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 as Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021
  As of March 31, 2022, cash on hand was $9,186,639, as compared to $14,590,566 as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $5,403,927, or 37%.
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, cash used in operations was $6,510,343, an increase of $5,381,752, or 121%, as compared to cash used of $1,128,591 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in cash used in operating activities was principally driven by the operating expenses of our 2021 Business Acquisitions, which included higher inventory purchases and prepayments, and accounts payable, offset by deferred revenue resulting in customer backlog for prepayments on future sales.
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $3,503,158, a decrease of $9,775,733, or 35.8%, as compared to cash used of $13,278,891 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in cash used in our investing activities resulted from the business acquisition of MicaSense in the prior year, offset by the increase in capitalized costs associated with the development of the HempOverview and Measure Ground Control platforms and the senseFly business acquisition.
  For the three months ended March 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $4,614,091, a decrease of $10,046,600, or 45.9%, as compared to cash provided of $14,660,691 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in cash provided by our financing activities was due to less sales of our Common stock through an at-the-market (“ATM”) offering and exercise of warrants in the prior year.
  Liquidity and Capital Resources
  As of March 31, 2022, we had working capital of $3,101,003. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, we incurred a loss from operations of $7,481,941, an increase of $4,521,141, or 152.7%, as compared to $2,960,800 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. While there can be no guarantees, we believe the cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from revenues, will be sufficient to fund the next twelve months of operations. In addition, we intend to pursue other opportunities of raising capital with outside investors.
  During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we raised $4,583,341 of net proceeds from our ATM offering with co-agents Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and Raymond James & Associates.
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
  On March 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

    Inflation
  During the three months ended March 31, 2022, inflation has a negative impact the unmanned aerial vehicle systems industry, our customers, and our business globally. Specifically, our ability to access components and parts needed in order to manufacture its proprietary drones and sensors, and to perform quality testing have been, and continue to be, impacted. If either the Company or any of its third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes continue to be adversely impacted, our supply chain may be further disrupted, limiting its ability to manufacture and assemble products. We expect inflation and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on its business
  Climate Change
  Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.
  New Accounting Pronouncements
