NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2023
(Unaudited)
  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation
  Organization and nature of operations
  Victory Oilfield Tech, Inc. (“Victory”), a Nevada corporation, is an oilfield technology products company offering patented oil and gas drilling products designed to improve well performance and extend the lifespan of the industry’s most sophisticated and expensive equipment. On July 31, 2018, Victory entered into an agreement to acquire Pro-Tech Hardbanding Services, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (“Pro-Tech”), which provides various hardbanding solutions to oilfield operators for drill pipe, weight pipe, tubing and drill collars.
  Basis of Presentation
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Victory and Pro-Tech, its wholly owned subsidiary, for all periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts between Victory and Pro-Tech (together, the “Company”) have been eliminated.
  The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements is in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
  In the opinion of the Company’s management, the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements contained herein includes all normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.
  The results reported in these consolidated financial statements should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year or any future periods.
  Going Concern
  Historically the Company has experienced, and continues to experience, net losses, net losses from operations, negative cash flow from operating activities and working capital deficits. The Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $(99,291,954) through March 31, 2023, and has a working capital deficit of $(3,858,055) at March 31, 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.
  The Company anticipates that operating losses will continue in the near term as management continues efforts to leverage the Company’s intellectual property through the platform provided by the acquisition of Pro-Tech and, potentially, other acquisitions. The Company intends to meet near-term obligations through funding under the New VPEG Note (See Note 8, Related Party Transactions) as it seeks to generate positive cash flow from operations.
  In addition to increasing cash flow from operations, we will be required to obtain other liquidity resources in order to support ongoing operations. We are addressing this need by developing additional capital sources, which we believe will enable us to execute our recapitalization and growth plan. This plan includes the expansion of Pro-Tech’s core hardbanding business through additional drilling services and the development of additional products and services including wholesale materials, RFID enclosures and mid-pipe coating solutions.
  Based upon anticipated new sources of capital and ongoing near-term funding provided through the New VPEG Note, we believe we will have enough capital to cover expenses through at least the next twelve months. We will continue to monitor liquidity carefully. In the event we do not have enough capital to cover expenses, we will make the necessary and appropriate reductions in spending to remain cash flow positive. While management believes our plans help mitigate the substantial doubt that we are a going concern, there is no guarantee that our plans will be successful or if they are, will fully alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt that we are a going concern.
  5
    Capital Resources
  As of the date of this report and for the foreseeable future the Company expects to cover operating shortfalls, if any, with funding through the New VPEG Note while we enact our strategy to become a technology-focused oilfield services company and seek additional sources of capital. As of the date of this report, the remaining amount available for the Company for additional borrowings on the New VPEG Note was $230,024. The Company is actively seeking additional capital from VPEG and potential sources of equity and/or debt financing.
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  Fair Value
  Financial Accounting Standard Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, established a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value. This framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three broad levels of inputs defined by FASB ASC Topic 820 hierarchy are as follows:
  Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date;
  Leve1 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Leve1 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
  Leve1 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity’s own data).
  Receivables are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. Receivables are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts of future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written down or off when a portion or all of such account receivable is determined to be uncollectible.
  At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments such as accounts receivable and payables approximated their fair values based on the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of short-term notes and advances approximated their fair values because the underlying interest rates approximated market rates at the balance sheet dates.
  Revenue Recognition
  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606) as it satisfies contractual performance obligations by transferring promised goods or services to the customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services. A good or service is transferred to a customer when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service.
  The Company has one revenue stream, which relates to the provision of hardbanding services by its subsidiary Pro-Tech. All performance obligations of the Company’s contracts with customers are satisfied over the duration of the contract as customer-owned equipment is serviced and then made available for immediate use as completed during the service period. The Company has reviewed its contracts with Pro-Tech customers and determined that due to their short-term nature, with durations of several days of service at the customer’s location, it is only those contracts that occur near the end of a financial reporting period that will potentially require allocation to ensure revenue is recognized in the proper period. The Company has reviewed all such transactions and recorded revenue accordingly.
  For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, all of the Company’s revenue was recognized from contracts with oilfield operators. See Note 9 Segment and Geographic Information and Revenue Disaggregation for further information.
  Because the Company’s contracts have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance obligations.
  6
    Concentration of Credit Risk, Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents placed with high credit quality institutions and accounts receivable due from Pro-Tech’s customers. Management evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. If management becomes aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations after a sale has occurred, the Company records an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectable from the customer. Accounts receivable are written off at the point they are considered uncollectible. An allowance of $0 and $0 has been recorded at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company suffered no bad debt losses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If the financial conditions of Pro-Tech’s customers were to deteriorate or if general economic conditions were to worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future. 
  As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, three customers comprised 50% and 78% of the Company’s gross accounts receivables, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, four and two customers comprised 62% and 54% of the Company’s total revenue, respectively.
  Property, Plant and Equipment
  Property, Plant and Equipment is stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. When property, plant and equipment is disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and any gain or loss is included in Other income/(expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.
  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, as follows: 
  Asset category   Useful Life
Welding equipment, Trucks, Machinery and equipment   5 years
Office equipment   5 - 7 years
Computer hardware and software   7 years
  See Note 3, Property, Plant and Equipment, for further information.
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
  Finite-lived intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and if applicable, impairment charges. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis or the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, if reliably determinable. The Company reviews its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
  The Company performs an impairment test of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company has determined that it is comprised of one reporting unit at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the goodwill balances of $145,149 are included in the single reporting unit. The carrying value of the single reporting unit is negative. To date, an impairment of goodwill has not been recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company bypassed the qualitative assessment, and proceeded directly to the quantitative test for goodwill impairment.
  The Company’s Goodwill balance consists of the amount recognized in connection with the acquisition of Pro-Tech. The Company’s other intangible assets are comprised of contract-based and marketing-related intangible assets, as well as acquisition-related intangibles. Acquisition-related intangibles include the value of Pro-Tech’s trademark and customer relationships, both of which are being amortized over their expected useful lives of 10 years beginning August 2018.
  PPP Loans
  The Company accounts for loans issued pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of the U.S. Small Business Administration as debt. The Company will continue to record the Second PPP Note as debt until either (1) the Second PPP Note is partially or entirely forgiven and the Company has been legally released, at which point the amount forgiven will be recorded as income or (2) the Company pays off the Second PPP Note. See Note 5, Notes Payable, and Note 11, Subsequent Events, for further information.
  Business Combinations
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
  7
    Share-Based Compensation
  The Company from time to time may issue stock options, warrants and restricted stock as compensation to employees, directors, officers and affiliates, as well as to acquire goods or services from third parties. In all cases, the Company calculates share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and expenses awards based on fair value at the grant date on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. In the case of third-party suppliers, the service period is the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period. For employees, directors, officers and affiliates, the service period is typically the vesting period. Share-based compensation is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 6, Stockholders’ Equity, for further information.
  Income Taxes
  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. Deferred tax assets, if any, include tax loss and credit carry forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
  Earnings per Share
  Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 28,037,713 and 28,037,713, respectively, at March 31, 2023 and 2022. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilutive effects of common stock equivalents such as options, warrants and convertible securities. Given the historical and projected future losses of the Company, all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents are considered anti-dilutive.
   In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer’s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options (“ASU 2021-04”). ASU 2021-04 provides guidance as to how an issuer should account for a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option (i.e., a warrant) that remains classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument. An issuer should measure the effect of a modification or exchange as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged warrant and the fair value of that warrant immediately before modification or exchange and then apply a recognition model that comprises four categories of transactions and the corresponding accounting treatment for each category (equity issuance, debt origination, debt modification, and modifications unrelated to equity issuance and debt origination or modification). The Company adopted ASU 2021-04 effective January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures.
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, and has since issued various amendments including ASU No. 2018-19, ASU No. 2019-04, and ASU No. 2019-05. The guidance and related amendments modify the accounting for credit losses for most financial assets and require the use of an expected loss model, replacing the currently used incurred loss method. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The Company adopted ASU-2016-13 effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  5. Notes Payable
  Paycheck Protection Program Loan
  On February 1, 2021, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $98,622 pursuant to a second draw loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The unsecured loan (the “Second PPP Loan”) is evidenced by a promissory note (the “Second PPP Note”) issued by the Company, dated January 28, 2021, in the principal amount of $98,622 with Arvest Bank.
  Under the terms of the Second PPP Note and the PPP, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1.0% per annum with a deferral of payments for the first 10 months. The term of the Second PPP Note is five years, though it may be payable sooner in connection with an event of default under the Second PPP Note. To the extent the amount of the Second PPP Loan is not forgiven under the PPP, the Company will be obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning after a ten-month deferral period provided in the Second PPP Note and through January 28, 2026. See Note 11, Subsequent Events, for additional information.
  The CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, the Company may apply for forgiveness for all or a part of the Second PPP Loan. The amount of the Second PPP Loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula established by the SBA. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on the Second PPP Loan forgiveness, only that portion of the Second PPP Loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered twenty-four-week period will qualify for forgiveness. Although the Company has used the entire amount of the Second PPP Loan for qualifying expenses, no assurance is provided that the Company will obtain forgiveness of the Second PPP Loan in whole or in part.
  The Second PPP Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty. The Second PPP Note provides for certain customary events of default, including the Company’s: (i) failure to make a payment when due; (ii) breach of the note terms; (iii) default on any other loan with the Lender; (iv) filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against the Company; (v) reorganization merger, consolidation or other change in ownership or business structure without the Lender’s prior written consent; (vi) adverse change in financial condition or business operation that the Lender believes may affect the Company’s ability to pay the Second PPP Note; and (vii) default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if the Lender believes the default may materially affect the Company’s ability to pay the Second PPP Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lender has customary remedies and may, among other things, require immediate payment of all amounts owed under the Second PPP Note, collect all amounts owing from the Company and file suit and obtain judgment against the Company.
  The foregoing description of the Second PPP Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Second PPP Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.
  Economic Injury Disaster Loan
  Additionally, on June 15, 2020, the Company received $150,000 in loan funding from the SBA under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) program administered by the SBA, which was expanded pursuant to the CARES Act. The EIDL is evidenced by a promissory note, dated June 11, 2020 (the “EIDL Note”) in the original principal amount of $150,000 with the SBA, the lender.
  Under the terms of the EIDL Note, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 3.75% per annum. The term of the EIDL Note is 30 years, though it may be payable sooner upon an event of default under the EIDL Note. Under the EIDL Note, the Company is obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning in December 2022 through the maturity date of June 11, 2050. The EIDL Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty.
  9
    The Company made interest-only payments of $1,462 and $731 on the EIDL Note during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  The Company recorded interest expense of $1,406 and $1,437 related to the EIDL Note for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  The EIDL Note provides for certain customary events of default, including: (i) a failure to comply with any provision of the EIDL Note, the related Loan Authorization and Agreement, or other EIDL loan documents; (ii) a default on any other SBA loan; (iii) a sale or transfer of, or failure to preserve or account to SBA’s satisfaction for, any of the collateral or its proceeds; (iv) a failure of the Company or anyone acting on its behalf to disclose any material fact to SBA; (v) the making of a materially false or misleading representation to SBA by the Company or anyone acting on their behalf; (vi) a default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if SBA believes the default may materially affect the Company’s ability to pay the EIDL Note; (vii) a failure to pay any taxes when due; (viii) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law; (ix) if a receiver or liquidator is appointed for any part of the Company’s business or property; (x) the making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (xi) has any adverse change in financial condition or business operation that SBA believes may materially affect the Company’s ability to pay the EIDL Note; (xii) effects any reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other transaction changing ownership or business structure without SBA’s prior written consent; or (xiii) becomes the subject of a civil or criminal action that SBA believes may materially affect the Company’s ability to pay the EIDL Note. The foregoing description of the EIDL Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the EIDL Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.
  New VPEG Note
  See Note 8, Related Party Transactions, for a description of the New VPEG Note. The outstanding balance on the New VPEG Note was $3,717,476 as of each of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

  On June 14, 2022, Pro-Tech, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Promissory Note and Security Agreement in the amount of $31,437 with Arvest Bank for a vehicle loan (the “Vehicle Loan”). The Vehicle Loan, which is secured by the vehicle, is repayable over five years, matures June 15, 2027, and is repayable at the rate of $586 per month including principal and interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. The monthly payments began on July 15, 2022. The remaining balance of the Vehicle Loan was $27,114 and $31,438 as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

  On July 11, 2022, Pro-Tech, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Promissory Note and Security Agreement with Arvest Bank for a revolving loan for up to $30,000 (the “Arvest Loan”). The Arvest Loan matures on July 11, 2023 and bears interest at 5.5% per annum, subject to change in accordance with the Variable Rate (as defined in the Promissory Note and Security Agreement), the calculation for which is the Wall Street Journal U.S. Prime Rate plus 0.75%.  Pursuant to the terms of the Arvest Loan, Pro-Tech is required to make monthly payments beginning on August 11, 2022 and until the maturity date, at which time all unpaid principal and interest will be due. Pro-Tech may prepay the loan in full or in part at any time without penalty. The Arvest Loan contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for a loan of this type. The Arvest Loan is secured by Pro-Tech’s inventory and equipment, accounts and other rights of payments, and general intangibles, as such terms are defined in the Uniform Commercial Code. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company borrowed $5,000, and $0, respectively, pursuant to the Arvest Loan.

  8. Related Party Transactions
  Settlement Agreement
  On August 21, 2017, the Company entered into a secured convertible original issue discount promissory note issued by the Company to VPEG (the “VPEG Note”). The VPEG Note was subsequently amended on October 11, 2017 and again on January 17, 2018. On April 10, 2018, the Company and Visionary Private Equity Group I, LP, a Missouri limited partnership (“VPEG”) entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release (the “Settlement Agreement”), pursuant to which VPEG agreed to release and discharge the Company from its obligations under the VPEG Note (see below). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, and in consideration and full satisfaction of the outstanding indebtedness of $1,410,200 under the VPEG Note, the Company issued to VPEG 1,880,267 shares of its common stock and a five-year warrant to purchase 1,880,267 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share, to be reduced to the extent the actual price per share in a proposed future private placement (the “Proposed Private Placement”) is less than $0.75. The Company recorded share-based compensation of $11,281,602 in connection with the Settlement Agreement.
  On April 10, 2018, in connection with the Settlement Agreement, the Company and VPEG entered into a loan Agreement (the “New Debt Agreement”), pursuant to which VPEG loaned to the Company $2,000,000 under a secured convertible original issue discount promissory note (the “New VPEG Note”). The loans made pursuant to the New VPEG Note reflect a 10% original issue discount, do not bear interest in addition to the original issue discount, are secured by a security interest in all of the Company’s assets, and at the option of VPEG are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.75 per share or, such lower price as shares of Common Stock are sold to investors in the Proposed Private Placement.

  9. Segment and Geographic Information and Revenue Disaggregation
  The Company has one reportable segment: Hardband Services. Hardband Services provides various hardbanding solutions to oilfield operators for drill pipe, weight pipe, tubing and drill collars. All Hardband Services revenue is generated in the United States, and all assets related to Hardband Services are located in the United States. Because the Company operates with only one reportable segment in one geographical area, there is no supplementary revenue or asset information to present.
  To provide users of the financial statements with information depicting how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors, we have disaggregated revenue by customer, with customers representing more than five percent of total annual revenues comprising the first category, and those representing less than five percent of total annual revenues comprising the second category.

    10. Net Loss Per Share
  Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilutive effects of common stock equivalents such as options, warrants and convertible securities. Basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 28,037,713 and 28,037,713 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  The following table sets forth the computation of net loss per common share – basic and diluted:

During the period of April 1, 2023 through May 15, 2023 the Company received additional loan proceeds of $15,000 pursuant to the Arvest Loan. See Note 5, Notes Payable, for further information.
  As of April 18, 2023, the Company received notice from Arvest Bank and the SBA that $92,653 of the $98,622 amount of the Second PPP Loan had been forgiven. The amount forgiven, including principal of $92,653 and accrued interest will be recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company will continue to record the remaining principal balance of $5,969 as debt, and it will record interest expense on the outstanding balance at a rate of one percent per annum until all principal and interest has been repaid. See Note 5, Notes Payable, for further information.

    Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
  Introduction
  The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand Victory Oilfield Tech, Inc. MD&A is presented in the following seven sections:
    ● Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements;
    ● Business Overview;
    ● Results of Operations;
    ● Liquidity and Capital Resources;
    ● Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates;
    ● Recently Adopted Accounting Standards; and
    ● Recently Issued Accounting Standards.
  MD&A summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow as of and for the periods presented below and is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Items 7 and 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
  In MD&A, we use “we,” “our,” “us,” “Victory” and “the Company” to refer to Victory Oilfield Tech. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context requires otherwise. Amounts and percentages in tables may not total due to rounding. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. We caution readers that important facts and factors described in MD&A and elsewhere in this document sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect our actual results, and could cause our actual results during the remainder of 2023 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us.
  As reported in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements, we have suffered recurring losses from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
  On July 31, 2018, we purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Pro-Tech, a hardbanding service provider.
  Cautionary Information about Forward-Looking Statements
  Many statements made in the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of federal securities laws and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan, strategies and capital structure. In particular, the words “anticipate,” “expect,” “suggests,” “plan,” “believe,” “intend,” “estimates,” “targets,” “projects,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “may,” “will,” “forecast,” variations of such words, and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or projections. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and projections. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include:
    ● continued operating losses;
    ● adverse developments in economic conditions and, particularly, in conditions in the oil and gas industries;
    ● volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets;
    ● our inability to successfully execute on our growth strategy;
  13
      ● the competitive nature of our industry;
    ● credit risk exposure from our customers;
    ● price increases or business interruptions in our supply of raw materials;
    ● failure to develop and market new products and manage product life cycles;
    ● business disruptions, security threats and security breaches, including security risks to our information technology systems;
    ● terrorist acts, conflicts, wars, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;
    ● failure to comply with anti-terrorism laws and regulations and applicable trade embargoes;
    ● risks associated with protecting data privacy;
    ● significant environmental liabilities and costs as a result of our current and past operations or products, including operations or products related to our licensed coating materials;
    ● transporting certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic nature;
    ● litigation and other commitments and contingencies;
    ● ability to recruit and retain the experienced and skilled personnel we need to compete;
    ● work stoppages, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force;
    ● delays in obtaining permits by our future customers or acquisition targets for their operations;
    ● our ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights;
    ● intellectual property infringement suits against us by third parties;
    ● our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions and divestitures;
    ● risk that the insurance we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures;
    ● risks associated with changes in tax rates or regulations, including unexpected impacts of the U.S. TCJA legislation, which may differ with further regulatory guidance and changes in our current interpretations and assumptions;
    ● our substantial indebtedness;
    ● the results of pending litigation;
    ● our ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms may be limited;
    ● any statements of belief and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing;
    ● other factors disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and
    ● other factors beyond our control.
  These cautionary statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. Potential investors should not make an investment decision based solely on our projections, estimates or expectations.
  Business Overview
  General
  Victory Oilfield Tech, Inc. (“Victory”, the “Company”, “we”), a Nevada corporation, is an Austin, Texas based publicly held oilfield energy technology products company focused on improving well performance and extending the lifespan of the industry’s most sophisticated and expensive equipment. America’s resurgence in oil and gas production is largely driven by new innovative technologies and processes as most dramatically and recently demonstrated by fracking. We provide and apply wear-resistant alloys for use in the global oilfield services industry which are mechanically stronger, harder and more corrosion resistant than typical alloys found in the market today. This combination of characteristics creates opportunities for drillers to dramatically improve lateral drilling lengths, well completion time and total well costs.

    On July 31, 2018, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Pro-Tech Hardbanding Services, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (“Pro-Tech”), which provides various hardbanding solutions to oilfield operators for drill pipe, weight pipe, tubing and drill collars and servicing Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. We believe that the acquisition of Pro-Tech will create opportunities to leverage its existing portfolio of intellectual property to fulfill its mission of operating as a technology-focused oilfield services company. The stock purchase agreement was included as Exhibit 10.1 on the Form 8-K filed by us on August 2, 2018.
  Our wear-resistant alloys reduce drill-string torque, friction, wear and corrosion in a cost-effective manner, while protecting the integrity of the base metal. We apply our coatings using advanced welding techniques and thermal spray methods. We also utilize common materials, such as tungsten carbide to chromium carbide, to deliver the optimal solution to the customers. Some of our hardbanding processes protect wear in tubulars using materials that achieve a low coefficient of friction to protect the drill string and casing from abrasion.
  Growth Strategy
  We plan to continue our U.S. oilfield services company acquisition initiative, aimed at companies which are already recognized as high-quality service providers to strategic customers in the major North American oil and gas basins. When completed, we expect that each of these oilfield services company acquisitions will provide immediate revenue from their current regional customer base, while also providing us with a foundation for channel distribution and product development of our existing products. We intend to grow each of these established oilfield services companies by providing better access to capital, more disciplined sales and marketing development, integrated supply chain logistics and infrastructure build out that emphasizes outstanding customer service and customer collaboration, future product development and planning.
  We believe that a well-capitalized technology-enabled oilfield services business will provide the basis for more accessible financing to grow the Company and execute our oilfield services company acquisitions strategy. We anticipate new innovative products will come to market as we collaborate with drillers to solve their other down-hole needs.
  Recent Developments
  Second PPP Loan
  As of April 18, 2023, we received notice from Arvest Bank and the SBA that $92,652.92 of the $98,622.50 amount of the Second PPP Loan had been forgiven. The amount forgiven, including principal of $92,652.92 and accrued interest, will be recorded as other income in our consolidated statements of operations. We will continue to record the remaining principal balance of $5,969.58 as debt, and we will record interest expense on the outstanding balance at a rate of one percent per annum until all principal and interest has been repaid. The entire amount of recorded gain on partial forgiveness of the Second PPP Loan will be excluded from income for tax purposes. See Note 5, Notes Payable, to the consolidated financial statements for a definition and description of the Second PPP Loan.
  New VPEG Note
  During the period of April 1, 2023 through May 15, 2023, we received additional loan proceeds of $52,500 from VPEG pursuant to the New VPEG Note (See Note 8, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for a definition and description of the New VPEG Note).
  15
 
Arvest Loan
  On July 11, 2022, Pro-Tech, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Promissory Note and Security Agreement with Arvest Bank for a revolving loan for up to $30,000 (the “Arvest Loan”).  During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we borrowed $5,000, and $0, respectively, pursuant to the Arvest Loan. During the period of April 1, 2023 through May 15, 2023, we received additional loan proceeds of $15,000 pursuant to the Arvest Loan. See LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES below and Note 5, Notes Payable, to the consolidated financial statements for a definition and description of the Arvest Loan
  Market Conditions
  Our financial results depend on many factors, including commodity prices and the ability of our customers to market their production on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions and other factors.
  In recent months, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has driven oil and natural gas prices up significantly, in part because of sanctions by the European Union, the United Kingdom and the U.S. on imports of oil and gas from Russia, and is expected to have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. Recent Russian actions have further contributed to global uncertainties for the future, causing even higher oil and natural gas prices. The ultimate impact of the war in Ukraine will depend on future developments and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.
  Two issues continue to affect national and global market conditions. First, supply chain disruptions continue to be problematic. Thus far, we have not experienced material adverse effects from materials shortages; however, timely sourcing of certain materials is of increased concern. Second, published articles and corporate announcements continue to address the global semiconductor chip shortage, which is anticipated to continue throughout 2023. This shortage could affect some of our customers which could impact our revenue, volume, and profitability. We continue to actively monitor these developments, including ongoing contact with our suppliers and customers, and adapting to their specific circumstances and forecasts.
  Although the current outlook on oil and natural gas prices is generally favorable and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the short-term, in the event further disruptions occur and continue for an extended period of time, our operations could be adversely impacted, and our costs may increase.
  Factors Affecting our Operating Results
  The following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operations as well as factors that impact those items.
  Total revenue
  We generate revenue from hardbanding solutions to oilfield operators for drill pipe, weight pipe, tubing and drill collars and grinding services.
  Our revenues are generally impacted by the following factors:
    ● our ability to successfully develop and launch new solutions and services
    ● changes in buying habits of our customers
    ● changes in the level of competition faced by our products
    ● domestic drilling activity and spending by the oil and natural gas industry in the United States
  Total cost of revenue
  The costs associated with generating our revenue fluctuate as a result of changes in sales volumes, average selling prices, product mix, and changes in the price of raw materials and consist primarily of the following:
    ● hardbanding production materials purchases
    ● hardbanding supplies
    ● labor
    ● depreciation expense for hardbanding equipment
    ● field expenses
  16
    Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”)
  Our selling, general and administrative expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products, as well as administrative overhead costs, including:
    ● compensation and benefit costs for management, sales personnel and administrative staff, which includes share-based compensation expense
    ● rent expense, communications expense, and maintenance and repair costs
    ● legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees and insurance expenses.
  These expenses are not expected to materially increase or decrease directly with changes in total revenue.
  Depreciation and amortization
  Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation of hardbanding equipment which is reported in Total cost of revenue.
  Interest expense
  Interest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense and loan fees on borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs, and debt discounts associated with our indebtedness.
  Other income/(expense), net
  Other income/(expense), net represents costs incurred, net of income, from various non-operating items including costs incurred in conjunction with our debt refinancing and extinguishment transactions, interest income, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, as well as non-operational gains and losses unrelated to our core business.
  Income tax benefit (provision)
  We are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, our operating results, the availability of any net operating loss carryforwards, any future business combinations, and changes to tax laws and regulations are key factors that will determine our future book and taxable income.
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our historical results of operations summarized and analyzed below may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future.
  Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022

    Total Revenue
  Total revenue increased by $24,647, or 7%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to an increase in the number of drilling rigs driving hardbanding and grinding revenue generated by Pro-Tech.
  Total Cost of Revenue
  Total cost of revenue increased by $4,363, or 3%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 due primarily to increases in materials, direct labor, and other direct costs resulting from increases in Pro-Tech’s revenue generating activities. Our gross profit margin increased to 51% during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to a gross profit margin of 49% during the three months ended March 31, 2022 as a result of higher revenue.
  Selling, general and administrative
  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $72,155, or 32%, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily as a result of accounting and audit fees related to fiscal 2022 audit as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Increases in insurance costs were partially offset by decreases in payroll and payroll taxes.
  Depreciation and amortization
  Depreciation and amortization increased by 4% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to fixed asset additions.
  Loss from Operations
  We reported a loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 of $(122,785), which was an increase of 74% compared to the loss from operations of $(70,691) for the three months ended March 31, 2022 due primarily to the increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses described above.
  Interest expense
  Interest expense decreased by $6,880, or 65%, to $3,687 in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to $10,567 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The overall decrease resulted from no borrowings on the VPEG note during the quarter. See Note 5, Notes Payable, to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
  Loss Applicable to Common Stockholders
  As a result of the foregoing, loss applicable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $(126,472), or $(0.00) per share, as compared to a loss applicable to common stockholders of $(81,258), or $(0.00) per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2022 on weighted average shares of 28,037,713 and 28,037,713, respectively.
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
  Going Concern
  Historically we have experienced, and we continue to experience, net losses, net losses from operations, negative cash flow from operating activities, and working capital deficits. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern.
  Management anticipates that operating losses will continue in the near term as we continue efforts to leverage our intellectual property through the platform provided by the acquisition of Pro-Tech and, potentially, other acquisitions. In the near term, we are relying on financing obtained from VPEG through the New VPEG Note in addition to borrowings pursuant to the Arvest loan to fund operations as we seek to generate positive cash flow from operations. See Note 5 Notes Payable, and Note 8 Related Party Transactions, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the New VPEG Note and the Arvest Loan. In addition to increasing cash flow from operations, we will be required to obtain other liquidity resources in order to support ongoing operations. We are addressing this need by developing additional capital sources which we believe will enable us to execute our recapitalization and growth plan. This plan includes the expansion of Pro-Tech’s core hardbanding business through additional drilling services and the development of additional products and services including wholesale materials, RFID enclosures and mid-pipe coating solutions. 
  Based upon capital formation activities as well as the ongoing near-term funding provided through the New VPEG Note and the Arvest Loan, we believe we will have enough capital to cover expenses through at least the next twelve months. We will continue to monitor liquidity carefully, and in the event we do not have enough capital to cover expenses, we will make the necessary and appropriate reductions in spending to remain cash flow positive.
  18
    Material Cash Requirements
  Our material short-term cash requirements include recurring payroll and benefits obligations for our employees, capital and operating expenditures and other working capital needs. Working capital, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, fluctuates depending on borrowing as well as effective management of receivables from our purchasers and payables to our vendors. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during the twelve months following March 31, 2023. We believe that material cash requirements for operating expenditures in excess of cash provided by operations may range from $0 per month to $20,000 per month during the twelve months following March 31, 2023.
  Our long-term material cash requirements from currently known obligations consist of repayment of outstanding borrowings and interest payment obligations.
  The following table summarizes our estimated material cash requirements for known obligations as of May 15, 2023. This table does not include amounts payable under obligations where we cannot forecast with certainty the amount and timing of such payments. The following table does not include any cash requirements related to our office space in Texas or the Pro-Tech facility in Oklahoma because the office space in Texas is leased on a month-to-month basis, and the lease agreement for the Pro-Tech facility in Oklahoma is cancellable at any time by giving notice of 90 days.

  (1) Subsequent to March 31, 2023, we received notification that $92,653 of this balance was forgiven
  We believe it will be necessary to obtain additional liquidity resources to satisfy our material cash requirements. We are addressing our liquidity needs by seeking to generate positive cash flows from operations and developing additional backup capital sources.
  Capital Resources
  As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and for the foreseeable future, we expect to cover operating shortfalls with funding through the New VPEG Note and the Arvest Loan while we enact our strategy to become a technology-focused oilfield services company and seek additional sources of capital. As of May 15, 2023, the remaining amount available to us for additional borrowings on the New VPEG Note was approximately $230,024. As of May 15, 2023, the remaining amount available to us for additional borrowings on the Arvest Loan was approximately $0.
  Paycheck Protection Program Loans
  On February 1, 2021, we received loan proceeds in the amount of $98,622 pursuant to a second draw loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The unsecured loan (the “Second PPP Loan”) is evidenced by a promissory note (the “Second PPP Note”) issued by us, dated January 28, 2021, in the principal amount of $98,622 with Arvest Bank.
  Under the terms of the Second PPP Note and the PPP, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 1.0% per annum with a deferral of payments for the first 10 months. The term of the Second PPP Note is five years, though it may be payable sooner in connection with an event of default under the Second PPP Note. To the extent the amount of the Second PPP Loan is not forgiven under the PPP, we will be obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning after a 10-month deferral period provided in the Second PPP Note and through January 28, 2026.
  The CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, we have applied for forgiveness for all or a part of the Second PPP Loan. The amount of Second PPP Loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness is based on a formula established by the SBA. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on forgiveness, only that portion of the Second PPP Loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered twenty-four-week period will qualify for forgiveness. Although we have used the entire amount of the PPP Loans for qualifying expenses, no assurance is provided that we will obtain forgiveness of the Second PPP Loan in whole or in part.
  19
    The Second PPP Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty. The Second PPP Note provides for certain customary events of default, including our: (i) failure to make a payment when due; (ii) breach of the note terms; (iii) default on any other loan with the Lender; (iv) filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against us; (v) reorganization merger, consolidation or other change in ownership or business structure without the Lender’s prior written consent; (vi) adverse change in financial condition or business operation that the Lender believes may affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note; and (vii) default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if the Lender believes the default may materially affect our ability to pay the Second PPP Note. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lender has customary remedies and may, among other things, require immediate payment of all amounts owed under the Second PPP Note, collect all amounts owing from us and file suit and obtain judgment against us.
  The foregoing description of the Second PPP Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Second PPP Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.
  Economic Injury Disaster Loan
  Additionally, on June 15, 2020, we received $150,000 in loan funding from the SBA under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) program administered by the SBA, which was expanded pursuant to the CARES Act. The EIDL is evidenced by a promissory note, dated June 11, 2020 (the “EIDL Note”) in the original principal amount of $150,000 with the SBA, the lender.
  Under the terms of the EIDL Note, interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the rate of 3.75% per annum. The term of the EIDL Note is 30 years, though it may be payable sooner upon an event of default under the EIDL Note. Under the EIDL Note, we are obligated to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning December, 2021 through the maturity date of June 11, 2050. The EIDL Note may be prepaid in part or in full, at any time, without penalty.
  We made interest-only payments of $1,462 and $731 on the EIDL Note during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  We recorded interest expense of $1,406 and $1,437 related to the EIDL Note for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  The EIDL Note provides for certain customary events of default, including: (i) a failure to comply with any provision of the EIDL Note, the related Loan Authorization and Agreement, or other EIDL loan documents; (ii) a default on any other SBA loan; (iii) a sale or transfer of, or failure to preserve or account to SBA’s satisfaction for, any of the collateral or its proceeds; (iv) a failure of us or anyone acting on its behalf to disclose any material fact to SBA; (v) the making of a materially false or misleading representation to SBA by us or anyone acting on our behalf; (vi) a default on any loan or agreement with another creditor, if SBA believes the default may materially affect our ability to pay the EIDL Note; (vii) a failure to pay any taxes when due; (viii) if we become the subject of a proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law; (ix) if a receiver or liquidator is appointed for any part of our business or property; (x) the making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (xi) has any adverse change in financial condition or business operation that SBA believes may materially affect our ability to pay the EIDL Note; (xii) effects any reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other transaction changing ownership or business structure without SBA’s prior written consent; or (xiii) becomes the subject of a civil or criminal action that SBA believes may materially affect our ability to pay the EIDL Note. The foregoing description of the EIDL Note does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the EIDL Note, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2020.
  New VPEG Note
  See Note 8, Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements for a definition and description of the New VPEG Note. The outstanding balance on the New VPEG Note was $3,717,476 as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
  The Company recorded interest expense of $0 and $7,700 related to the New VPEG Note for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  Vehicle Loan
  On June 14, 2022, our wholly-owned subsidiary Pro-Tech Hardbanding Services, Inc. entered into a Promissory Note and Security Agreement in the amount of $31,437.60 with Arvest Bank for a vehicle loan (the “Vehicle Loan”). The Vehicle Loan, which is secured by the vehicle, is repayable over five years, matures June 15, 2027, and is repayable at the rate of $586.23 per month including principal and interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum. The monthly payments began on July 15, 2022. The remaining balance of the Vehicle Loan was $27,114 and $0 as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  Arvest Loan
  On July 11, 2022, Pro-Tech, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Promissory Note and Security Agreement with Arvest Bank for a revolving loan for up to $30,000 (the “Arvest Loan”). The Arvest Loan matures on July 11, 2023 and bears interest at 5.5% per annum, subject to change in accordance with the Variable Rate (as defined in the Promissory Note and Security Agreement), the calculation for which is the Wall Street Journal U.S. Prime Rate plus 0.75%.  Pursuant to the terms of the Arvest Loan, Pro-Tech is required to make monthly payments beginning on August 11, 2022 and until the maturity date, at which time all unpaid principal and interest will be due. Pro-Tech may prepay the loan in full or in part at any time without penalty. The Arvest Loan contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for a loan of this type. The Arvest Loan is secured by Pro-Tech’s inventory and equipment, accounts and other rights of payments, and general intangibles, as such terms are defined in the Uniform Commercial Code. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we borrowed $5,000, and $0, respectively, pursuant to the Arvest Loan. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Pro-Tech had balances of $15,000 and $10,000, respectively, on the credit line.
  20
    We made principal and interest payments of $1,761 and $0 on the Arvest Loan during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  We recorded interest expense of $316 and $0 related to the Arvest Loan for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  Cash Flow
  The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:
      Three Months Ended March 31,  
    2023     2022  
Net cash used in operating activities   $ (84,668 )   $ (95,654 )
Net cash used in investing activities     --       --  
Net cash provided by financing activities     37,055       77,000  
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents     (47,613 )     (18,654 )

Cash and cash equivalents at end of period   $ 26,023     $ 34,254  
  Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $84,668. Net loss adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization) used cash of $10,453. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $74,215. The most significant uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in accounts payable and prepaids and other current assets. These changes were offset by cash provided by an increase accrued and other short-term liabilities.
  This compares to net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $95,654. Net loss adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization) used cash of $27,395. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $95,654. The most significant uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to timing of collections, inventory due to purchases, and prepaids and other current assets. These changes were partially offset by cash provided by increases in accounts payable and accrued and other short-term liabilities.
  No cash was provided by or used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022.
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $37,055 and resulted from debt financing proceeds from Arvest Bank of $5,000 and a short-term advance from Inspire Diagnostics, an affiliated entity, of $33,500, net of vehicle loan repayments. This compares to $77,000 in net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 resulting from debt financing proceeds from affiliates.
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:
   Revenue Recognition
  We recognize revenue as it satisfies contractual performance obligations by transferring promised goods or services to the customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services. A good or service is transferred to a customer when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service.

    We have one revenue stream, which relates to the provision of hardbanding services by its subsidiary Pro-Tech. All performance obligations of our contracts with customers are satisfied over the duration of the contract as customer-owned equipment is serviced and then made available for immediate use as completed during the service period. We have reviewed our contracts with Pro-Tech customers and determined that due to their short-term nature, with durations of several days of service at the customer’s location, it is only those contracts that occur near the end of a financial reporting period that will potentially require allocation to ensure revenue is recognized in the proper period. We have reviewed all such transactions and recorded revenue accordingly.
  For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, all of our revenue was recognized from contracts with oilfield operators, and we did not recognize impairment losses on any receivables or contract assets.
  Because our contracts have an expected duration of one year or less, we have elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance obligations.
  Concentration of Credit Risk, Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents placed with high credit quality institutions and accounts receivable due from Pro-Tech’s customers. Management evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. If management becomes aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations after a sale has occurred, we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectable from the customer. Accounts receivable are written off at the point they are considered uncollectible. An allowance of $0 and $0 has been recorded at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We suffered no bad debt losses in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If the financial conditions of Pro-Tech’s customers were to deteriorate or if general economic conditions were to worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future. 
  As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, three and three customers comprised 50% and 78% of our gross accounts receivables, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, four and two customers comprised 63% and 54% of our total revenue, respectively.
  Property, Plant and Equipment
  Property, Plant and Equipment is stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. When property, plant and equipment is disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and any gain or loss is included in Other income/(expense) in the consolidated statement of operations.
  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, as follows:
  Asset category   Useful Life
Welding equipment, Trucks, Machinery and equipment   5 years
Office equipment   5 - 7 years
Computer hardware and software   7 years
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
  Finite-lived intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and if applicable, impairment charges. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis or the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, if reliably determinable. We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
  We perform an impairment test of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We have determined that the Company is comprised of one reporting unit at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the goodwill balances of $145,149 at the end of each period are included in the single reporting unit. To date, an impairment of goodwill has not been recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we bypassed the qualitative assessment, and proceeded directly to the quantitative test for goodwill impairment.
  Our Goodwill balance consists of the amount recognized in connection with the acquisition of Pro-Tech. Our other intangible assets are comprised of contract-based and marketing-related intangible assets, as well as acquisition-related intangibles. Acquisition-related intangibles include the value of Pro-Tech’s trademark and customer relationships, both of which are being amortized over their expected useful lives of 10 years beginning August 2018.
  Business Combinations
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

    Share-Based Compensation
  From time to time we may issue stock options, warrants and restricted stock as compensation to employees, directors, officers and affiliates, as well as to acquire goods or services from third parties. In all cases, we calculate share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and expenses awards based on fair value at the grant date on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. In the case of third-party suppliers, the service period is the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period. For employees, directors, officers and affiliates, the service period is typically the vesting period. Share-based compensation is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 6, Stockholder’s Equity, for further information.
  Income Taxes
  We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. Deferred tax assets, if any, include tax loss and credit carry forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
  Earnings per Share
  Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 28,037,713 and 28,037,713, respectively, at March 31, 2023 and 2022. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilutive effects of common stock equivalents such as options, warrants and convertible securities. Given the historical and projected future losses of the Company, all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents are considered anti-dilutive.
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, and has since issued various amendments including ASU No. 2018-19, ASU No. 2019-04, and ASU No. 2019-05. The guidance and related amendments modify the accounting for credit losses for most financial assets and require the use of an expected loss model, replacing the currently used incurred loss method. Under this model, entities will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss on such instruments and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. We adopted ASU-2016-13 effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

    Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Discussions about Market Risk
  Not applicable.
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
  As required by Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer determined that, because of the material weakness described in Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which we are still in the process of remediating as of March 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.
  During the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, our management identified the following material weaknesses:
    ● We lack sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represents a material weakness.
  ● We believe we lack sufficient training and oversight with respect to potential cyber security risks. We are not aware of any breaches of our information systems, nor any theft, loss, or unwanted exposure of data contained within our information systems; however, due to the risk that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of this control deficiency, our management has concluded that the control deficiency represents a material weakness.
  As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our management has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses, and through the date of this report, we continued to assess and implement remedial procedures. In order to cure the foregoing material weaknesses, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions are performed by separate individuals to the extent possible. In addition, we will look to hire additional personnel with technical accounting expertise to further support our current accounting personnel. As necessary, we will continue to engage consultants or outside accounting firms in order to ensure proper accounting for our consolidated financial statements. We intend to implement additional preventive and detective controls, including establishment of new procedures for oversight over cyber security by our Board of Directors, employee cyber security training, and implementation of new risk assessment and incident response protocols.
  We intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weaknesses that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation, as needed.
  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
  Except for the matters described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
