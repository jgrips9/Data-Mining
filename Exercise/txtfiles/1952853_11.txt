  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
  This Report contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements contained in this Report other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, projected costs and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “should,” “shall,” “intend,” “goal,” “objective,” “seek,” “expect,” and similar expressions or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to:
  ● our limited operating history on which to judge our performance and assess our prospects for future success;
● risks related to our reliance on a network of independent dealers and distributors to manage the retail distribution of many of our products;
● our reliance on third-party manufacturers and supplies for our products;
● risks related to the fact that the majority of the products we purchase are manufactured by suppliers in China and their operations are subject to risks associated with business operations in China;
● the inexperience of our principal shareholder and senior management in operating a publicly traded company;
● economic conditions that impact consumer spending may have a material adverse effect on our business;
● results of operations or financial condition;
● risks related to face intense competition in all product lines, including from some competitors that have greater financial and marketing resources;
● risks related to our ability to attract and retain key personnel;
● potential harm caused by misappropriation of our data and compromises in cybersecurity;
● changes in laws, regulatory requirements, governmental incentives and fuel and energy prices;
● litigation, regulatory proceedings, complaints, product liability claims and/or adverse publicity;
● the inability of our dealers, customers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital or financing;
● failure to develop brand name and reputation;
● the significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls;
● the impact of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our business; and
● other risks and uncertainties described in this Report, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section.
  Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.
  You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this Report or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.
  In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.
  You should read this Report and the documents that we reference in this Report and have filed as exhibits to the registration statement, of which this Report is a part, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this Report by these cautionary statements.

  NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
  Massimo Group (the “Company”), is a holding company established on October 10, 2022 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in the manufacturing and sales of a wide selection of farm and ranch tested utility terrain vehicles (“UTVs”), recreational all-terrain vehicles (“ATVs”), and pontoon and tritoon boats (“Pontoon Boats”). On April 4, 2024, the Company closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 1,300,000 shares of its common stock at an IPO price of $4.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $5.85 million from the offering (Note 15). In connection with the offering, the Company’s common shares began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol “MAMO.” Mr. David Shan, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), is the controlling shareholder (the “Controlling Shareholder”) of the Company and owns 77.6% equity interest of Massimo Group as of June 30, 2024.
  Reorganization
  On June 1, 2023, the two shareholders transferred their 100% equity interest in Massimo Motor Sports, LLC (“Massimo Motor Sports”) and 100% equity interest in Massimo Marine, LLC (“Massimo Marine”) to Massimo Group (the “Reorganization”). After this Reorganization, Massimo Group ultimately owns 100% equity interests of Massimo Motor Sports and Massimo Marine.
  Before and after the Reorganization, the Company, together with its subsidiaries, is effectively controlled by the same Controlling Shareholders, and therefore the Reorganization is considered as a recapitalization of entities under common control in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805-50-25. The consolidation of the Company and its subsidiaries have been accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if the aforementioned transactions had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5.
  Details of the Company and its subsidiaries are set out below upon the Reorganization:

  On June 1, 2023, the Company entered into two agreements with Asian International Securities Exchange Co., Ltd. (“AISE”) and AISE agreed to invest $1 million to Massimo Motor Sports and $1 million to Massimo Marine to exchange their 15% of equity interest respectively. After Reorganization, the 15% of equity interest in Massimo Motor Marine and Massimo Marine owned by AISE have been exchanged to 15% of equity interest in Massimo Group.

  NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company as of June 30, 2024, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or any other period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the accounting records of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 15, 2024.
  Uses of estimates and assumptions
  In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Significant accounting estimates required to be made by management include allowance for inventories, allowance for credit losses, sales return liabilities, warranty costs and the assessment and the disclosure of contingency liabilities. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and its estimates on historical experience, current and expected future conditions and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances based on the information available to management at the time these estimates and assumptions are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.
  Cash and cash equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, the balances with banks and the liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains all its bank accounts in the United States, which are insured by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
  Accounts receivable, net
  Accounts receivable represent trade receivable and are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently adjusted for any allowance for expected credit loss. The Company grants credit to customers, without collateral, under normal payment terms. The Company uses a loss rate method to estimate the allowance for credit losses. The Company evaluates the expected credit loss of accounts receivable based on customer financial condition and historical collection information adjusted for current market economic conditions and forecasts of future economic performance when appropriate. Loss-rate approach is based on the historical loss rates and expectations of future conditions. The Company writes off potentially uncollectible accounts receivable against the allowance for credit losses if it is determined that the amounts will not be collected.

  NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
  Inventories, net
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. Costs include the cost of raw materials, freight and duty. Any excess of the cost over the net realizable value of each item of inventories is recognized as a provision for diminution in the value of inventories. Net realizable value is estimated using selling price in the normal course of business less any costs to complete and sell products. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had inventory provision of $439,900 and $439,900, included in inventories, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. Impairment provision of inventories were $nil and $nil for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
  Advances to suppliers
  Advance to suppliers consists of balances paid to suppliers for purchasing of products, parts and accessories that have not been provided or received. Advances to suppliers are short-term in nature and are reviewed periodically to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired. The Company evaluated the carrying value of individual advances based on specifics facts and circumstances for any impairment at each reporting date. For the three-month period and six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded the impairment loss of $742,897, $742,897, $nil and $nil respectively on its advances to suppliers in connection of an expected settlement between the Company and one supplier in September 2024.
  Deferred offering cost
  Deferred offering costs were expenses directly related to the Company’s planned IPO. These costs consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and filing fees that the Company capitalized, including fees incurred by the independent registered public accounting firm directly related to the offering. The deferred offering costs are reclassified to additional paid-in capital upon receipts of the capital raised at IPO closing date.
  Property and equipment
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the related assets over their useful lives using the straight-line method, as follows:
      Useful life
Furniture and fixtures   5-7 years
Machinery equipment   5-7 years
Electronic equipment   5 years
Transportation equipment   5 years
Leasehold improvement   Over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives
  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are recognized within “other income (expense)” in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

  Leases
  The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02—Leases (Topic 842) since January 1, 2020, using a modified retrospective transition method permitted under ASU No. 2018-11. This transition approach provides a method for recording existing leases only at the date of adoption and does not require previously reported balances to be adjusted. The Company evaluates the contracts it enters into to determine whether such contracts contain leases. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. At commencement, contracts containing a lease are further evaluated for classification as an operating or finance lease where the Company is a lessee.
  Operating Leases
  For operating leases, the Company measures its lease liabilities based on the present value of the total lease payments not yet paid discounted based on the more readily determinable of the rate implicit in the lease or its incremental borrowing rate, which is the estimated rate the Company would be required to pay for a collateralized borrowing equal to the total lease payments over the term of the lease. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The Company measures right-of-use (“ROU”) assets based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, and initial direct costs it incurs under the lease. The Company begins recognizing lease expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the Company.
  Lease cost for operating leases includes the amortization of the ROU asset and interest expense related to the operating lease liability. For leases with lease term less than one year (short-term leases), the Company records operating lease expense in its consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease payments as incurred.
  Finance Leases
  Lease cost for finance leases where the Company is the lessee includes the amortization of the ROU asset, which is amortized on a straight-line basis and recorded to “Depreciation of right-of-use finance asset” and interest expense on the finance lease liability, which is calculated using the interest method and recorded to “Interest expense, net.” Finance lease ROU assets are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, including periods covered by renewal options that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising.
  Impairment of long-lived assets
  Long-lived assets, primarily consist of property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than the Company had originally estimated. When these events occur, the Company evaluates the impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value of the assets. No impairment charge was recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

  NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
  Fair value of financial instruments
  ASC 825-10 requires certain disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
  ● Level 1 — inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
● Level 2 — inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
● Level 3 — inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.
  Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, short-term loans, note receivable which was grouped in other current assets, accounts payable, other payable, accrued expense and other liabilities, contract liabilities, due to shareholder and current portion of lease liabilities, approximates their recorded values due to their short-term maturities. The Company determined that the carrying value of the lease liabilities approximated their fair value as the interest rates used to discount the contracts approximate market rates. The Company noted no transfers between levels during any of the periods presented. The Company did not have any instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring nor non-recurring basis as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
  Revenue recognition
  The Company adopted ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following steps:
  Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
  The Company’s revenue is generated primarily by sales of UTVs, ATVs electric bikes (“e-bikes”), and Pontoon Boats. Revenue represented the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods. Revenue is recorded when performance obligations are considered to be satisfied when control is transferred to our customers upon goods delivered to customers and acceptance by customers.

  NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
  Sales returns
  The Company provides a refund policy to accept returns from end customers, which varies and depends on the different products and customers. The estimated sales returns are determined based upon an analysis of historical sales returns. Return allowances are recorded as a reduction in sales with corresponding sales return liabilities which are included in “accrued return liabilities.” The estimated cost of returned inventory is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales and an increase of right of return assets which is included in “inventories.” As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $202,273 and $283,276 of sales return liabilities associated with estimated product returns were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded sales returns of $398,058 and $425,906 respectively. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded sales returns of $823,763 and $1,105,428 respectively.
  Products warranty
  The Company generally provides a one-year limited warranty against defects in materials related to the sale of products. The Company considers the warranty as an assurance type warranty since the warranty provides the customer the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications. Estimated future warranty obligations are included in cost of product sales in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. The determination of the Company’s warranty accrual is based on actual historical experience with the product, estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment. The Company estimates and adjusts these accruals at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $732,565 and $619,113 of product warranty were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded warranty expenses of $459,366 and $583,047 respectively. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded warranty expenses of $846,325 and $931,199 respectively.
  Contract liabilities
  The contract liabilities of the Company are primarily related to advances received from customer. The contract liabilities are reported in a net position on a customer-by-customer basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract liabilities are recognized when the Company receives prepayment from customers resulting from purchase order. Contract liabilities will be recognized as revenue when the products are delivered. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company records contract liabilities of $1,205,431 and $1,835,411, respectively, which will be recognized as revenue upon delivery of the products sold. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the amounts transferred from contract liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal period to revenue were $929,686 and $696,274, respectively.
  Disaggregation of revenues
  The Company disaggregates its revenue from contracts by products, as the Company believes it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Company’s disaggregation of revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is disclosed in Note 18 of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
  Cost of revenues
  Cost of revenues includes all of the costs and expenses directly related to the production of goods and services included in revenues. Cost of revenues primarily consists of cost of products, freight and duty allocated and warehouse related overhead, such as salaries and benefits, rent, warehouse supplies and depreciation expenses.

  Shipping and handling costs
  Shipping and handling costs, which include costs related to the selection of products and their delivery to customers, are presented in cost of revenues and selling expenses. The shipping and freight expense incurred upon goods delivery to customers are included in selling expenses, amounting to $1,954,821 and $1,340,766 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The shipping and freight expense incurred upon goods delivery to customers are included in selling expenses, amounting to $3,061,868 and $2,435,562 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
  The freights and duty costs incurred when shipping raw materials from suppliers to the Company are included in cost of revenues, amounting to $3,488,294 and $2,480,954 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The freights and duty costs incurred when shipping raw materials from suppliers to the Company are included in cost of revenues, amounting to $6,175,941 and $5,159,250 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
  Advertising costs
  The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs presented in selling expenses were $175,290 and $270,877 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Advertising costs presented in selling expenses were $403,766 and $462,663 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
  401(k) benefit plan
  The 401(k) benefit plan covers substantially all employees and allows voluntary employee contributions up to the annually adjusted Internal Revenue Service dollar limit. These voluntary contributions are matched equal to 100% of the employee’s compensation contributed and not to exceed 4% of the total eligible compensation. The employees’ voluntary contributions and the Company’s matching contributions are 100% vested immediately. The Company adopted the 401(k) benefit plan from March 2022.
  Income taxes
  Before the Reorganization, the Company elected to be taxed as an S Corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. As an S Corporation, the Company is not subject to federal income tax and state tax in Texas. As such, shareholders are taxed on their pro rata share of earnings and deductions of the Company, regardless of the amount of distributions received. After the Reorganization, the Company is subjected to U.S. federal income tax at 21% and the margin tax in the state of Texas.
  Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
  The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic No. 740, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.

The first step is to evaluate whether an income tax position has met the recognition threshold by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The second step is to measure the income tax position that has met the recognition threshold as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provisions, income taxes payable and deferred income taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as interest expense.
  Earnings per share
  The Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” (“ASC 260”). ASC 260 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, a total of 63,614 unvested Restricted Stock Units (“RSU”) were included in the computation of weighted average number of common shares for the calculation of diluted EPS. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no dilutive shares.
  Stock Based compensation
  The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 260”), which establishes the accounting for employee share-based awards. For employee share-based awards, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
  Segment reporting
  The Company follows ASC 280, “Segment Reporting.” The Company’s Chief Executive Officer or chief operating decision-maker reviews the consolidated financial results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company as a whole and hence, the Company has only one reportable segment. The Company operates and manages its business as a single segment. As the Company’s long-lived assets are all located in the United States and substantially all the Company’s revenues are derived from within the United States, no geographical segments are presented.
  Concentration and risks
  a. Concentration of credit risk
  Assets that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and other receivable included in other current assets. The maximum exposure of such assets to credit risk is their carrying amounts at the balance sheet dates. The Company maintains all the bank accounts at financial institutions in the United States, where there is $250,000 standard deposit insurance coverage limit per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank and per ownership category. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, one bank balance in Massimo Motor Sports exceeded the insured limited by $433,931 and $330,357, respectively.
  To limit the exposure to credit risk relating to deposits, the Company primarily places cash deposits with large financial institutions in the United States. The Company conducts credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral or other security from them. The Company establishes an accounting policy to provide for current expected credit losses based on the individual customer’s financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions.

  Concentration and risks (continued)
  b. Foreign Exchange Risk
  Most of our raw materials are imported from China. The value of the Chinese Yuan against the U.S. dollar is affected by the changes in China and United States economic conditions. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk.
  c. Interest Rate Risk
  Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest rates from our lessors and our borrowings with banks. The shareholder loans bear no interest. Our leasing obligations’ interest rates are fixed at the commencement date of the leases. We have not been exposed to material risks due to the fact that our borrowing from the bank is not significant. And we have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rate in the future.
  d. Liquidity Risk
  Liquidity risk arises through the excess of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. Our objective in managing liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet our liquidity requirements at any point in time. We achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash and banking facilities.
  e. Significant customers
  For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, one and one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, one and one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, one and one customers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, respectively.
  f. Significant suppliers
  For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, three and two suppliers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total purchases respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, three and two suppliers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total purchases respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, two and three suppliers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total accounts payable, respectively.

  NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
  Recent accounting pronouncements
  The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued.
  The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act provides that an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined therein can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an EGC to delay adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has adopted the extended transition period.
  In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity,” which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. This ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The new standard will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2024, using either a modified retrospective or a fully retrospective method of transition, and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements.
  In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. Management is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.
  In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income tax paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, once adopted.
  The Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and comprehensive income and statements of cash flows.

  NOTE 14 — TAXES
  Corporate Income Taxes
  Massimo Motor and Massimo Marine both terminated their status as a Subchapter S Corporation as of June 1, 2023, in connection with the Reorganization and became a taxable C Corporation. Prior to that date, as an S Corporation, the Company had no U.S. federal income tax expense. As such, any periods prior to June 1, 2023 will only reflect a margin tax for the state of Texas and corresponding tax expense. As a C Corporation, the Company combined effective tax rate for federal income taxes of 21% and state margin tax.
  As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have an accrued liability for uncertain tax positions and does not anticipate recognition of any significant liabilities for uncertain tax positions during the next 12 months. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, no amounts were incurred for income tax uncertainties or interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position. The Company’s tax years since its formation remain subject to possible income tax examination by its major taxing authorities for all periods. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are 23.4% and 5.4% respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are 25.4% and 5.2% respectively. The primary differences between the annual effective tax rate and statutory tax rates are mainly contributed by S Corporation benefits and the state margin taxes.

  Initial Public Offering
  On April 4, 2024, the Company closed its IPO of 1,300,000 shares of its common stock at an IPO price of $4.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $5.85 million from the offering. The total net proceeds to the Company from the IPO, after deducting discounts, expense allowance, and expenses, were approximately $5.0 million. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, dated as of April 1, 2024, by and between Craft Capital Management LLC (the “Representative”) and the Company (the “Underwriting Agreement”), the underwriters had an overallotment option, exercisable for 45 days by May 19, 2024, to purchase up to an additional 195,000 shares from the Company at the offering price less of $4.50 the underwriting discount and commissions to cover over-allotments. As of the reporting date, no such option has been exercised.
  Common Shares Issued for Service
  On June 18, 2024, the Company signed a consulting agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with TJCM Asset Management LLC (“TJCM”) to provide strategic consulting and financial advisory services to the Company for twelve months from June 18, 2024. As partial of consideration for the services, TJCM is entitled to receive shares of the Company’s common stock equivalent to a value of $160,000 calculated by the valuation price defined as average closing price of the Company’s shares of common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the Consulting Agreement. On June 21, 2024, the Company issued 22,485 shares of common stock to TJCM as the prepayment of $80,000 on the services to be provided.
  Representative’s Warrants
  Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company issued to the Representative and its designee warrants (the “Representative’s Warrants”) to purchase 87,100 shares of common stock. The Representative’s Warrants are exercisable at a per share exercise price equal to $5.625 and are exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the period commencing on October 4, 2024 and terminating on April 4, 2029. Neither the Representative’s Warrants nor any of the shares issued upon exercise of the Representative’s Warrants may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated, or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of such securities by any person, for a period of six months immediately following the commencement of sales of the offering.
  Management determined that these warrants meet the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815-40 because they are indexed to their own shares and meet the requirements for equity classification. The warrants were recorded at their fair value on the date of grant as a component of shareholders’ equity. The fair value of these warrants was $143,000, which was considered a direct cost of IPO and included in additional paid-in capital. The fair value has been estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: market value of underlying share of $4.00, risk free rate of 4.3%, expected term of five years; exercise price of the warrants of $5.63, volatility of 56%; and expected future dividends of nil.
  As of June 30, 2024, 87,100 warrants in connection with IPO funding was outstanding, with an exercise price of $5.63 and remaining life of 4.76 years.

  NOTE 18 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
  Contingencies
  The Company may be involved in certain legal proceedings, claims and disputes arising from the commercial operations, which, in general, are subject to uncertainties and in which the outcomes are not predictable. The Company determines whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company can give no assurances about the resolution of pending claims, litigation or other disputes and the effect such outcomes may have on the Company, the Company believes that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings, to the extent not otherwise provided or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations or liquidity as at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
  Legal cases
  On July 8, 2024, the Company received a court judgment issued in favor of the counterparty in the amount of approximately $3.3 million for damage related to the breach of the distribution agreement and sales contracts, plus interest and attorneys’ fees. The Company had courter-claims against the party at the same time. On August 7, 2024, the Company filed the notice to appeal and will continue to vigorously defend the Lawsuit. The appeal is likely to take between 12 and 24 months. The Company believes the ultimate outcome is still uncertain and that the likelihood of loss is remote in the near future (see Note 20). As of June 30, 2024, the accounts payable balance regarding this counterpart is approximately $2.3 million, which can be used to offset any potential future settlement.

  An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and is identified on the basis of the internal financial reports that are provided to and regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources and assess performance of the segment.
  Management of the Company concludes that it has only one reporting segment. The Company is primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing and sales of a wide selection of farm and ranch tested UTVs, recreational ATVs, and Pontoon Boats.
  The Company’s CEO reviews consolidated results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company, rather than by product types or geographic area; hence the Company concluded it has only one reporting segment.

  Note 20 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
  Legal cases
  On July 8, 2024, the Company received a court judgment issued in favor of the counterparty in the amount of approximately $3.3 million for damage related to the breach of the distribution agreement and sales contracts, plus interest and attorneys’ fees. The Company had courter-claims against the party at the same time. On August 7, 2024, the Company filed the notice to appeal and will continue to vigorously defend the Lawsuit. The appeal is likely to take between 12 and 24 months. The Company believes the ultimate outcome is still uncertain and that the likelihood of loss is remote in the near future (see Note 18). As of June 30, 2024, the accounts payable balance regarding this counterpart is approximately $2.3 million, which can be used to offset any potential future settlement.
  Short-term loan paid of
  As of June 30, 2024. the outstanding balance of short- term loan was $2.7 million. The balance of $2.7 million at Cathay Bank was used to pay off the undue letter of credit at Midfirst bank for them to release the first-position right to Cathay bank. The balance was paid off in the subsequent period.
  The Company evaluated all events and transactions that occurred after June 30, 2024 up through the date the Company issued these condensed consolidated financial statements, and unless disclosed above, there are not any material subsequent events that require disclosure in these consolidated financial statements.

    Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Report and with the audited financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), on April 15, 2024. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements .”
  Overview of Company
  Massimo Group is a holding company established on October 10, 2022 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We, through our subsidiaries, are primarily engaged in the manufacturing and sales of a wide selection of farm and ranch tested UTVs, recreational ATVs, and Pontoon Boats. Mr. David Shan, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the Controlling Shareholder of the Company.
  A Reorganization of the legal structure was completed on June 1, 2023. The Controlling Shareholder transferred his 100% equity interest in Massimo Motor and 100% equity interest in Massimo Marine to Massimo Group. After this Reorganization, we ultimately own 100% equity interests of Massimo Motor Sports and Massimo Marine.
  Before and after the Reorganization, we, together with our subsidiaries, are effectively controlled by the same Controlling Shareholder, and therefore, the Reorganization is considered as a recapitalization of entities under common control in accordance with ASC 805-50-25. The consolidation of the Company and our subsidiaries have been accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if the aforementioned transactions had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5.
  We listed our common stocks on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MAMO” on April 4, 2024 and completed our IPO of 1,300,000 shares of common stock on April 4, 2024, raising approximately $5.0 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.
  We currently generate most of our revenues from the sales of UTVs and ATVs, which represented 96.7% and 83.5% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from sales of UTVs and ATVs represented 96.0% and 85.2% of total revenue, respectively.
  We also generate revenue from the sales of Pontoon Boats, which represented 3.3% and 16.5% of our revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from the sales of Pontoon Boats represented 4.0% and 14.8% of our revenue, respectively.
  Trends and Key Factors that Affect Operating Results
  We believe the most significant factors that affect our business and results of operations include the following:
  ●
Risk of intense competition in the industry: The powersports vehicles and boats industry in the United States is highly competitive. Competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors, including price, quality, service, reliability, styling, product features and warranties. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors including sales and marketing support programs (such as financing, joint advertising programs and cooperative advertising). Certain of our competitors are more diversified and have financial and marketing resources which are substantially greater than ours, which allow these competitors to invest more heavily in intellectual property, product development, and sales and marketing support. Failure to compete effectively with rival products, features, or models, or to draw in new dealers, could significantly harm our business, financial condition, or operating results.
  We are subject to competitive pricing. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to maintain prices or to increase prices for our products in response to raw material, component and other cost increases and so negatively affect our profit margins.
  1
    ● Risk of economic and policy changes within China: We import our products from various Chinese suppliers. The Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry within China by imposing industrial policies, providing subsidies and heavily regulating or prohibiting unwanted activities. There is no assurance the Chinese government will not interfere with the operations of Linhai Powersports (with which we have a significant supplier relationship) or any of our other suppliers. In addition, the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustments, to control the pace of economic growth in China. These measures, or other economic, political, or social developments in China may affect our China-based suppliers, which may adversely affect our business and operating results. We also import our products from Taiwan. The Taiwan issue is a longstanding point of contention between China and the United States. The U.S. maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan, while also recognizing the One China policy, which acknowledges Beijing as the legitimate government of Taiwan. Both China and the U.S. have engaged in military posturing around the Taiwan Strait. This increases the risk of accidental clashes or misunderstandings that could escalate into conflict, which will affect both our China-mainland-based and Taiwan-based suppliers.
    ● Risk of unavailability of additional capital: We will require significant expenditures to fund future growth. We intend to fund our growth out of the proceeds of the IPO and internal sources of liquidity or through additional financing from external sources. Our ability to obtain external financing in the future at a reasonable cost is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the condition of the global and domestic financial markets. If we require additional funds and cannot obtain them on acceptable terms when required or at all, we may be unable to fulfill our working capital needs, upgrade our existing facilities or expand our business and may have to reduce the level of our operations. These factors may also prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business or implementing our future strategies. Any debt financing that we undertake may be expensive and might impose covenants that restrict our operations and strategic initiatives, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, make investments and engage in mergers, consolidations and asset sale transactions. Equity financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our shareholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our equity securities may be lower than the trading prices of such equities. If new sources of financing are required, but are unattractive, insufficient or unavailable, then we could be required to modify our business plans or growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
    ● Risk of uncertainty in the cost and production level of raw materials: We depend on third-party suppliers to manufacture many of the products we sell, in particular, ATVs and UTVs, as opposed to our recreational boats which we manufacture in our Dallas facility. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we purchased approximately 62% and 64% of our products from three of these suppliers. Competition for the output of these suppliers is intense. If these independent suppliers were unwilling or unable to supply us with products at prices which enable us to maintain our gross margins, it would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we are looking to broaden our supplier base and to reduce our dependence upon a limited number of suppliers, there is no assurance we will be able to do so and increasing the number of suppliers from which we purchase products may increase our costs.
    ● Risk related to overseas freights fluctuation: The inflation rate and supply chain crisis experienced in 2021 and 2022 led to a significant increase in overseas freight costs. However, by December 31, 2023, there was a notable easing in both inflation and freight costs, reflecting an improvement in economic conditions and a stabilization in the supply chain.
    ● Risk related to inflation: In recent years, our China-based suppliers have increased the cost of their products due to inflation. We may not be able to pass along price increases in raw materials, parts, or components to customers. As a result, an increase in the cost of the raw materials, parts, and components our suppliers use in the manufacture of our products could reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
    ● Risk of fluctuations in the sale of Pontoon Boats: A segment of our sales revenue stemming from Massimo Marine exhibits a seasonal sales pattern. Boat sales are also influenced by the financing arrangements for boat purchases, which are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenue generated from Massimo Marine was approximately 3.3%, 4.0%, 16.5% and 14.8% of our total revenue, respectively.

    Revenues.
  Revenues increased by $8.7 million, or 32.4%, from $26.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, to $35.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in revenue was primarily due to combined effect of rising demand in the U.S. ATV and UTV market and our modified sales strategy. In 2024, we continued to expand our distribution network with various retailers to increase our products’ market penetration. We strategically focused our efforts on big box retailers that offer their own financing plans, while moving away from retailers that have liberal return policies.

  Revenue from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes
  Revenue from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes increased by $11.9 million, or 53.3%, from $22.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, to $34.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in revenue was primarily attributed to the expansion into more large retail stores in the U.S. (as “big box stores”). In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, our sales to those big box stores were $12.7 million. These increased to $25.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with $20.3 million of these sales from one new customer since fiscal 2023. This surge is consistent with the increasing ranch/farm-work utilization of UTVs across the 1.89 million farms in the U.S. with an average size of 464 acres and the new customer’s rural lifestyle focus. The increase in sales is also due to a shift in our sales strategy, focusing mostly on in-store sales at this new customer, which generally involve larger volumes and fewer returns. In addition, sales to this new customer consist of high-turnover inventory products that are of high quality and have a strong customer reputation. This enhances the efficiency of our capital utilization.
  Revenue from sales of Pontoon Boats
  Revenue from sales of Pontoon Boats decreased by $3.2 million, or 73.5%, from $4.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, to $1.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the fact that we shifted from retailing to dealer sales starting in fiscal 2024 and the dealers have experienced high rejection rates at the floorplan financing providers such as Northpoint. This is consistent with the industry-wide trend. Additionally, the challenging economic environment, characterized by rising interest rates and inflation, has further constrained sales of luxury boats.
  Gross profit
  Our gross profit increased by $3.4 million, or 41.9%, from $8.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, to $11.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The gross profit margin was 32.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, compared with 30.3% in the same period last year. The increase of 2.2% in the gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher net sales partly due to decreased return, which was partly offset by higher cost of sales due to increased freight costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared with last year.
  Our cost and gross profit by revenue types are as follows:

    The cost of revenue on UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes increased by $8.2 million, or 55.7%, from $14.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $23.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and the gross profit increased by $3.6 million, or 48.6%, from $7.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $11.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The gross margin decreased by 1.1%, from 33.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to 32.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in the cost of revenue was in line with the increase in sales. The slight decrease in gross margin was mainly due to a rise in global container freight in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our freight costs increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared with last year.
  The cost of revenue on Pontoon Boats decreased by $3.0 million, or 76.5%, from $3.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $0.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and the gross profit decreased by $0.3 million, or 51.6%, from $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The gross margin increased by 10.1%, from 12.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to 22.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in gross margin was primarily because of strategically focusing on selling higher-margin models of Pontoon Boats in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to that of fiscal 2023.
  Selling expenses
  Our selling expenses mainly include warranty expense, advertising and promotion expense, shipping and handling fee and merchant service fee. They increased by $0.6 million, or 24.6%, from $2.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $3.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, representing 8.7% and 9.3% of our total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The increase in selling expenses was mainly due to an increase in shipping and handling fees, which were approximately $2.0 million and $1.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The increase is consistent with the increase in sales.
  General and administrative expenses
  Our general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits, professional fees, office expenses, travel expenses, insurance expenses, rent expense and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million, or 22.7%, from $3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $4.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was mainly due to increased salaries and benefits, impairment loss and rent expense, which were partly offset by a decrease in professional and legal fees. Our general and administrative expenses represented 11.6% and 12.5% of our total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and the second quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively.
  Our salaries and benefits were $1.7 million and $1.0 million, representing 42.3% and 30.9% of our total general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively. The increase in balance was mainly due to one-off salaries compensation paid to an employee as result of employment termination and stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million recognized on RSUs and stock option grant.
  Our rent expenses increased by $0.3 million or 94.4%, from $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, representing 12.9% and 8.2% of our total general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had a rent increase of $0.05 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 because we had two new lease agreements in May 2024. Our property taxes included in the rent expenses also increased by $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year.
  Our professional fees decreased by $0.5 million or 46.2%, from $1.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, representing 13.6% and 31.0% of our total general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to reduced legal fees arising from ongoing lawsuits.
  Impairment loss on supplier deposit due to lawsuit
  During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a one-time impairment loss of approximately $0.7 million on advanced deposit to one supplier. In June 2024, we reached a tentative agreement regarding general settlement terms with one suppler who would pay approximately $342,000 including interest to resolve the claim. Our prepayment of $1.1 million would be considered irrecoverable. Therefore, we wrote off the approximately $742,000 of prepayment to the supplier during the three months ended June 30, 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we had no impairment loss of prepayment.
  Interest expenses
  Our interest expense decreased by $58,365 or 46.7%, from $125,012 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $66,647 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in interest expense was mainly because we lowered the average loan balance in second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the same period of last year in light of high interest rates.
  5
    Other income, net
  Our other income was $132,268 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared with $26,973 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of $105,295, or 390.4%. The increase was primarily related to writing off a long outstanding negative balance of account receivable of approximately $90,000. The write-off increased the other income in in second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the same period of the previous year.
  Income before income taxes
  We had an increase of $1.4 million in income before income taxes from $2.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to approximately $3.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit by $3.4 million, which was partly offset by an increase of general and administrative expenses of approximately $0.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as well as other expenses as discussed above.
  Provision for income taxes
  The income tax expense was approximately $0.8 million and $0.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in balance was mainly due to the increase in taxable income as a result of increased sales in second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with same period last year. Additionally, we were subjected to higher tax rate in second quarter of fiscal 2024 because we terminated our status as an S Corporation as of June 1, 2023, in connection with the Reorganization and became a taxable C Corporation. As such, the income tax provision for the whole income in second quarter of fiscal 2024 combined both federal income tax of 21% and the state margin tax at Texas as a C Corporation.
  Net income
  We had net income of $2.8 million and $2.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased revenues and gross profit as discussed above.

    Revenue
  Revenues increased by $20.0 million, or 43.8%, from $45.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $65.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in revenue was primarily due to combined effects of rising demand in the U.S. ATV and UTV market and our modified sales strategy. In 2024, we continued to expand our distribution network with various retailers to increase our products’ market penetration. We strategically focused our efforts on large retail stores in the U.S. (the “big box stores”) that offer their own financing plans, while moving away from retailers that have liberal return policies.

  Revenue from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes
  Revenue from sales of UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes increased by $24.1 million, or 62.1%, from $38.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to $62.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in revenue was primarily attributed to the expansion into more big box stores. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, our sales to those big box stores were $19.2 million. They increased to $48.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, with $40.0 million of these sales from one new customer since fiscal 2023. This surge is consistent with the increasing ranch/farm-work utilization of UTVs across the 1.89 million farms in the U.S. with an average size of 464 acres and the new customer’s rural lifestyle focus. The increase in sales is also due to a shift in our sales strategy, focusing mostly on in-store sales to this new customer, which generally involve larger volumes and no returns. In addition, sales to this new customer consist of high-turnover inventory products that are of high quality and have a strong customer reputation. This enhances the efficiency of our capital utilization.
  Revenue from sales of Pontoon Boats
  Revenue from sales of Pontoon Boats decreased by $4.1 million, or 61.1%, from $6.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the fact that we shifted from retailing to dealer sales in fiscal 2023 and the dealers have experienced high rejection rates at the floorplan financing providers such as Northpoint since late fiscal 2023. This is consistent with the industry-wide trend. Additionally, the challenging economic environment, characterized by rising interest rates and inflation, has further constrained sales of luxury boats such as our yacht.
  Gross profit
  Our gross profit increased by $8.2 million, or 60.0%, from $13.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to $22.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Gross profit margin was 33.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared with 30.1% in the same period last year. Our gross profit margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased slightly from the same period in 2023 due to a reduction of freight costs since 2023.

    Cost of revenue on UTVs, ATVs and e-bikes increased by $15.4 million, or 59.2%, from $26.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $41.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and gross profit increased by $8.7 million, or 68.2%, from $12.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $21.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Gross margin slightly increased by 1.2%, from 32.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to 34.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the cost of revenue was in line with the increase in sales. The slight increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to decreased global container freight. Our freight costs decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared with last year.
  Cost of revenue on Pontoon Boats decreased by $3.7 million, or 63.1%, from $5.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and gross profit decreased by $0.5 million, or 49.4%, from $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Gross margin increased by 4.3%, from 14.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to 18.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in gross margin was primarily because of strategically focusing on selling higher-margin models of Pontoon Boats for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023.
  Selling expenses
  Our selling expenses mainly include warranty expense, advertising and promotion expense, shipping and handling fee and merchant service fee. They increased by $0.9 million, or 19.6%, from $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $5.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, representing 8.1% and 9.7% of our total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our selling expenses increased mainly due to an increase in shipping and handling fee which were approximately $3.1 million and $2.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is consistent with the increase in sales.
  General and administrative expenses
  Our general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits, professional fees, office expenses, travel expenses, insurance expenses, rent expense and depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.9 million, or 29.7%, from $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly due to the increased rent expense, salaries and benefit, and insurance expense, which was partly offset by decreased professional and legal fee. Our general and administrative expenses represented 12.5% and 13.9% of our total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
  Our salaries and benefits were $2.8 million and $2.1 million, representing 34.7% and 33.7% of our total general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the balance was mainly due to a severance package of $0.5 million paid to an employee as result of employment termination and the stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million recognized on RSUs and stock option grants.
  Our rent expenses increased by $0.6 million or 92.1%, from $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, representing 15.0% and 10.1% of our total general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our rent expense increased because we had two new lease agreements in May 2024 and one lease agreement in May 2023. Our property taxes included in the rent expenses also increased by $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, when compared with the same period last year.
  Our professional and legal fees decreased by $0.4 million or 22.6%, from $1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, representing 16.1% and 27.0% of our total general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to decreased legal fees arising from ongoing lawsuits.

    Impairment loss on supplier deposit due to lawsuit 
  During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a one-time impairment loss of approximately $0.7 million on advanced deposit to one supplier. In June 2024, we reached a tentative agreement regarding general settlement terms with one suppler who would pay approximately $342,000 including interest to resolve the claim. Our prepayment of $1.1 million would be considered irrecoverable. Therefore, we wrote off the approximately $742,000 of prepayment to the supplier during the six months ended June 30, 2024. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had no impairment loss of prepayment.
  Interest expenses
  Our interest expense decreased by $75,769 or 27.0%, from $280,110 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $204,341 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in interest expense was mainly because we lowered the average loan balance during the six months ended June 30, 2024, when compared with the same period last year in light of increasing interest rates.
  Other income, net
  Our other income of $379,837 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared with $71,868 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, increased by $307,969, or 428.5%. The increase was primarily because (i) we wrote off a vendor’s account payable balance by $177,147 as a result of a settlement between the vendor and us and (ii) we wrote off long outstanding negative balance of account receivable of approximately $90,000. The write-offs increased the other income for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
  Income before income taxes
  We had an increase of $4.9 million in income before income taxes from $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to approximately $7.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase of gross profit by $8.2 million, which was partly offset by an increase of general and administrative expenses by approximately $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as well as other expenses as discussed above.
  Provision for income taxes
  The income tax expense was approximately $1.7 million and $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We terminated our status as an S Corporation as of June 1, 2023, in connection with the Reorganization and became a taxable C Corporation. As such, the income tax provision for the first half of fiscal 2024 combined both federal income tax of 21% and the state margin tax at Texas as a C Corporation, and the income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 only reflected state margin tax at Texas as a S Corporation and a federal income tax of 21% for only one month’s operation.
  Net income
  We had net income of $6.0 million and $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased revenues and gross profit as discussed above.
  Cash Flows
  For the Periods Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023
  The following table sets forth summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities     7,801,015       (2,730,050 )
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents     512,064       (16,104 )
Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of the period     765,814       947,971  
Cash and cash equivalents, end of the period   $ 1,277,878     $ 931,867  
  Operating Activities
  Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $7.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $2.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, representing an increase in the net cash used in operating activities of $9.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. This is consistent with the Company using part of the IPO proceeds as working capital to grow sales. The increase is primarily due to the following:
  ● Account payable decreased by approximately $4.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of approximately $0.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily because we used the line of credit bank loan to settle account payable during the six months ended June 30, 2024.
    ● Accounts receivable increased by approximately $2.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to an increase by approximately $3.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to the timing difference of settlement by customers.
  9
    ● Inventory increased by approximately $5.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a decrease by approximately $2.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024.
    ● The balance was partly offset by an increase in net income by approximately $3.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with same period in 2023.
    ● Our net income was adjusted for non-cash items, including written-off of account receivables, non-cash operating lease expense, gain (loss) on disposal of fixed asset, impairment loss of asset, stock-based compensation expense, amortization and depreciation, deferred tax expense (recovery) and provision (reversal of allowance) for expected credit loss. Non-cash items of approximately $1.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to non-cash items of approximately $0.6 million during the same period in 2023.
  Investing Activities
  Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.2 during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $0.02 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used investing activities was primarily attributable to purchase of property and equipment of $0.3 million offsetting by a proceed of $0.2 million from sale of property and equipment during the six months ended June 30, 2024.
  Financing Activities
  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $7.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of approximately $2.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to net proceed from bank loan of $2.7 million, net proceed from IPO of $4.5 million and the common shares subscription of $0.08 million, offset by the repayment of other loans of $0.3 million; combined with the net repayment of bank loan of $0.1 million and repayment of $2.6 million to shareholder during the six months ended June 30, 2023.
  Liquidity and Capital Resources
  Overview
  The general objectives of our capital management strategy reside in the preservation of our capacity to continue operating, in providing benefits to our stakeholders and in providing an adequate return on investment to our shareholders by selling our products at a price commensurate with the level of operating risk assumed by us.
  We thus determine the total amount of capital required consistent with risk levels. This capital structure is adjusted on a timely basis depending on changes in the economic environment and risks of the underlying assets. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
  Working Capital
  As of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.3 million. Our current assets were approximately $45.2 million, including approximately $11.5 million accounts receivable, approximately $30.8 million inventory, approximately $0.9 million advance to suppliers and approximately $0.7 million prepayment and other receivables, and our current liabilities were approximately $18.1 million, including $2.7 million bank loan, $8.2 million accounts payable to suppliers, $1.2 million contract liabilities, $4.1 million income tax payable, and $1.0 million liabilities from obligations under operating and financing leases, which resulted in a positive working capital of $27.1 million.
  Our primary source of cash is currently generated from our business and bank borrowings. In the coming years, we will be looking to other sources, such as raising additional capital by issuing shares of stock, to meet our cash needs. While facing uncertainties regarding the size and timing of capital raise, we are confident that we can continue to meet operational needs solely by utilizing cash flows generated from our operating activities.

  Off-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements
  There were no off-balance sheet arrangements for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, that have, or that in the opinion of management are likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions, and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
  Management has determined that, while there are no critical accounting estimates, the most significant estimates relate to sales returns, products warranty, allowance for credit loss, inventory provision, and the assessment and disclosure of contingent liabilities due to on-going lawsuit. Each of these are discussed below.
  Sales returns
  We provide a refund policy to accept returns from end customers, which varies and depends on the different products and customers. The estimated sales returns are determined based upon an analysis of historical sales returns. Return allowances are recorded as a reduction in sales with corresponding sales return liabilities which are included in “accrued return liabilities.” The estimated cost of returned inventory is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales and an increase of right of return assets which is included in “inventories.” As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $202,273 and $283,276 of sales return liabilities associated with estimated product returns were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded sales return credits of $398,058 and $425,906 respectively. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded sales return credits of $823,763 and $1,105,428 respectively.
  Warranty
  We generally provide a one-year limited warranty against defects in materials related to the sale of products. We consider the warranty as an assurance type warranty since the warranty provides the customer the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications. Estimated future warranty obligations are included in cost of product sales in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. The determination of our warranty accrual is based on actual historical experience with the product, estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment. We estimate and adjust these accruals at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $732,565 and $619,113 of product warranty were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, respectively. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded warranty expenses of $459,366 and $583,047 respectively. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded warranty expenses of $846,325 and $931,199 respectively.
  12
    Allowance for credit loss
  We considered various factors, including nature, historical collection experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances and the contract assets, credit quality and specific risk characteristics of its customers, current economic conditions, forecasts of future economic conditions, reversion period, and qualitative and quantitative adjustments to develop an estimate of credit losses. We have adopted loss rate method to calculate the credit loss and considered the relevant factors of the historical and future conditions of the Company to make reasonable estimation of the risk rate. For accounts receivable aged less than one year and non-overdue contract assets, we use the loss rate method, which is a combination of historical rate method and adjustment rate method, to estimate the credit loss. For accounts receivable aged over one year and overdue retainage receivable, we use the individual specific valuation method to estimate the credit loss.
  We wrote off potentially uncollectible accounts receivable against the allowance for credit losses if it is determined that the amounts will not be collected. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded allowance for credit loss of $0.8 million and $0.6 million in the consolidated balance sheet, respectively.
  Inventory provision
  We assessed the net realizable value of each item of inventories and compared to the cost on the book, which include the cost of raw materials, freight and duty for raw materials, direct labor costs, and the overhead costs for finished goods at the end of each reporting period. In addition, we assessed all slow-moving or obsolete items for inventory valuation purposes. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had inventory provision of $0.4 million and $0.4 million in the consolidated balance sheet respectively.
  Contingencies
  We may be involved in various legal proceedings, claims and other disputes arising from the commercial operations, projects and other matters which , in general, are subject to uncertainties and in which the outcome are not predictable. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although we can give no assurances about the resolution of pending claims, litigation or other disputes and the effect such outcomes may have on us, we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings, to the extent not otherwise provided or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the our unaudited condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations or liquidity as at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
  Although our significant accounting policies are elaborated upon in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements, we maintain that there were no critical accounting policies.
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
  As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the “Certifying Officers”), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report.
  13
    A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we concluded that our controls over the classification of related party payables, and accounting for related party notes payable was not effectively designed or maintained. Our management performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our unaudited financial statements included in this Report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the unaudited financial statements included in this Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the periods presented.
  In light of the material weakness described above, our management team has performed additional accounting and financial analyses and other post-closing procedures. We have enhanced, and will continue to enhance, internal controls and procedures, including access to accounting literature, identification and consideration of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and implementing additional layers of reviews in the financial close process. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements and other literature for all significant or unusual transactions, we plan to continue to improve these processes to ensure that the nuances of such transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards. 
  We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
  Other than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
