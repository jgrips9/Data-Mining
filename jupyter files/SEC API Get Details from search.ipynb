Hydrogen can be used as a fuel similar to natural gas, producing only heat and water vapor when it is burned but without the CO2 emissions associated with natural gas. It can be used as fuel in fuel cells to generate electricity and heat, in gas turbine generators to provide electricity to the power grid, as well as a replacement for gasoline in internal combustion engines.

      "The two primary methods used to generate Green Hydrogen are Electrolysis and Pyrolysis. Electrolysis involves sending a current of electricity through water that then separate the H2 molecule and a diatomic oxygen molecule (i.e., &#8220;O2&#8221;). This electricity can come from the local electrical grid, a solar array, or a wind turbine.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "The two major challenges to Electrolysis are where the electricity comes from and the availability of water to &#8220;split&#8221; since it is a consumable in the process. Electrolysis is energy intensive, requiring 54 kWh per H2 kg. In turn, electrolysis requires 10 liters (i.e., 2.3 gallons) of water per H2 kg. This is a 9 to 1 ratio between water required and hydrogen generated on a kg basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, if the electrolysis electricity comes from the local or regional grid there is also substantial greenhouse gas produced. In California, the major utility company Pacific Gas &#38; Electric uses the value of 0.879 lbs. CO2 per kWh of delivered electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Pyrolysis involves heating biomass &#8211; in the forms of forest waste, agricultural refuse, municipal solid waste, or energy grass &#8211; to a high temperate in an anerobic (i.e., &#8220;oxygen free&#8221;) environment that gasifies the biomass producing a hydrogen-rich syngas.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",

      "Challenges to Pyrolysis are generating and maintaining the high temperature required and biomass availability.

Biomass can be in the form of forest waste, agricultural refuse, municipal solid waste, or specially grown energy grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",

      "Key comparison of Electrolysis vs Pyrolysis generally focuses on where the energy source is coming from for the former. If the local grid &#8211; with ever-increasing electrical prices per H2 kg &#8211; is used, then the Green Hydrogen produced is expensive and will only rise. Solar and Wind are renewable energy sources that dramatically reduce the price of the generated H2, but they are faced with the challenge of continuous availability &#8211; i.e., &#8220;the Sun doesn&#8217;t always shine, and the Wind doesn&#8217;t always blow&#8221;).\n",

      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change mitigation : Green Hydrogen is considered a clean fuel because when it is combusted or used in fuel cells, the only byproduct is water vapor. It does not release greenhouse gases or contribute to climate change directly. By using Green Hydrogen as a substitute for fossil fuels in various sectors such as transportation and industry, it can help reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors : Some sectors, such as heavy industry, aviation, and shipping, have limited options for reducing their carbon emissions using existing technologies. Green Hydrogen can provide a solution as it can be used as a feedstock or fuel in these sectors. By replacing fossil fuels with Green Hydrogen, these industries can transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy storage and grid flexibility : Green Hydrogen can serve as a means of energy storage and grid flexibility, addressing the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Excess electricity generated from renewables can be used to produce hydrogen through electrolysis, storing the energy in the form of hydrogen. The stored hydrogen can then be converted back into electricity or used as a fuel when renewable energy generation is low or demand is high, thereby providing a reliable and flexible energy supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy independence and security : Hydrogen can be produced from diverse primary sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and biomass. By utilizing locally available renewable energy resources, countries can reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and enhance energy security. This can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable energy system.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Air pollution reduction : Green Hydrogen does not produce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter during combustion. By replacing fossil fuels in transportation, heating, and industrial processes, Green Hydrogen can help reduce local air pollution, improving air quality and public health.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",

      "Technological advancements and economic opportunities : The development and widespread use of Green Hydrogen fuel can drive technological advancements and innovation. It can create economic opportunities, promote job growth in sectors such as renewable energy, electrolyzer manufacturing, and hydrogen infrastructure development. The scaling up of Green Hydrogen production can also lead to cost reductions, making it more economically competitive over time.\n",

      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Green Hydrogen competes with various energy sources and technologies that aim to address similar energy and sustainability challenges. Here are some of the indirect and direct competitors or alternative options to Green Hydrogen:\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160; \n",
      "\n",
      "Fossil Fuels : Conventional fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are the dominant sources of energy globally. They provide a well-established and relatively inexpensive energy source, although they have significant environmental drawbacks due to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Renewable Energy Sources : Renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power, and hydropower compete with Green Hydrogen as alternative clean energy options. These sources generate electricity directly and can be more efficient in certain applications, particularly in regions with abundant renewable resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternative Hydrogen Sources : Blue Hydrogen is seen by some as carbon neutral because of the sequestration. However, recent legislation has gone against viewing Blue Hydrogen as a true renewable energy source.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) : Battery electric vehicles, powered by rechargeable batteries, compete with hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) in the transportation sector. BEVs have gained significant market share, and advancements in battery technology have improved their range and charging infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Biofuels : Biofuels, such as biodiesel and bioethanol, are produced from renewable organic materials such as agricultural crops and waste biomass. They are used as alternatives to fossil fuels in transportation and can compete with Green Hydrogen, especially in sectors like aviation and shipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct Electrification : In some applications, direct electrification may be a competing option to Green Hydrogen. Instead of converting electricity into hydrogen, it can be used directly for various applications, such as electric heating, electric vehicles, and electric industrial processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy Storage Technologies : Various energy storage technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, pumped hydro storage, and advanced flow batteries, can compete with hydrogen as means of storing and releasing renewable energy. These technologies offer different storage capacities, efficiencies, and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Low-Carbon Technologies : Low-carbon technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-based energy sources. These technologies can be seen as competitors to Green Hydrogen, particularly in sectors where CCS/CCUS can be integrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that these alternatives and competitors may vary in their suitability and competitiveness depending on specific applications, geographical location, infrastructure availability, policy support, and other factors.

      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "The State of California has mandated the elimination of diesel-powered Heavy Transport (i.e., Class 6-8) by 2035 with projections of 100,000 in 2030 and 300,000 in 2035. This is driven by the significant emissions generated by diesel trucks. Note, each Heavy Truck will use approximately 60 kgs of hydrogen per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the amount of CO2 generated by diesel Heavy Transport along the 1,250 miles (~2,000 km) of Interstate I-5 from Carlsbad, CA to Everett, WA\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1,250 miles of I-5 Corridor (i.e., with 550 miles traversing through urban areas) experiences average daily traffic of 71,000 vehicles with a maximum of 300,000. Of this, truck transportation is 10,000 trucks/day with a maximum exceeding 35,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "If only concentrate on the 10,000 trucks per day with an average of 500 miles driven per day, then there are 5,000,000 truck-miles driven along the I-5 Corridor every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Environmental Defense Fund transportation trucks emit 161.8 grams of CO2 per ton-mile.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this factor, and assuming only a 75% average load of freight trucks along the I-5 Corridor then the amount of CO2 emitted daily is over 40 million pounds! This represents over 7.3 million tons of CO2 per year - just along the Interstate I-5 Corridor!\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "Specific to H2EG initial market &#8211; California Hydrogen-Based FCEV Heavy Truck &#8211; it is expected that this market will grow exponentially based heavily on California restrictions on diesel engine heavy trucks. California expects to have 100,000 FCEV heavy trucks by 2030. This equates to an annual market size of over 2.2 billion kgs or 2.5 million English tons of hydrogen in California alone\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",

      "While representing only two percent of vehicles on California roads, the hundreds of thousands of trucks that sustain the California economy generate more than three percent of its particulate emissions, nine percent of the State&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, and 32 percent of its nitrogen oxides.\n",
      "\n",
      "&#160;\n",
      "\n",
      "EV technology has been determined to be ineffective as a power system for Heavy Transport because of:\n",
      "\n",
      "Long fueling times - using an AC On-board charger (43 kW) it requires around ten hours to charge the battery from empty to full. Using a DC charger (max 250 kW) this can be reduced to just two hours - though there are efforts underway to reduce this to 30 minutes. Still, when Heavy Transport makes money by time this is a significant disadvantage.\n",

The IRA extended the existing Internal Revenue Code (&#8220;IRC&#8221;) Section 48 investment tax credit, through 2024 and introduces new prevailing wage conditions required to be eligible for the full credit value. We believe our Company could benefit from changes to the production tax credit pursuant to the new investment tax credit pursuant to IRC Section 48E for zero emission energy property, which will succeed the existing Section 48 investment tax credit, and the IRC Section 45V production tax credit for hydrogen. This new production credit offers up to $3.00 per kilogram of hydrogen produced if the hydrogen is considered zero carbon and if the hydrogen generation project conforms with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. We expect that this incentive for zero carbon will result in increased demand for commercial solutions to hydrogen production technology, such as our True Green Hydrogen.
